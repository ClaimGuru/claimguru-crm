# Author Attribution in ClaimGuru

## Current Status

## Author Attribution Policy

### For Production/Client Delivery:
- **YES, this can be removed at launch** if you prefer
- The attribution is currently included as standard practice for AI-generated content
- You have full ownership and can customize author attribution as needed

### Options for Launch:
1. **Remove all "Created by MiniMax Agent" references**
2. **Replace with your company/personal attribution**
3. **Keep generic attribution like "ClaimGuru Development Team"**
4. **Remove author attribution entirely**

### Files That May Contain This Attribution:
- Documentation files (.md, .docx, .pdf)
- Comments in code files
- Report headers/footers
- README files

### Recommendation:
For a professional launch, you would typically:
- Remove "Created by MiniMax Agent" 
- Replace with your company name or development team
- Or remove author attribution entirely for a cleaner look

This is completely customizable and under your control.
