In Section I Conditions, the following changes are made:  

A. Item 3, What You Must Do After A Loss, is replaced by the following:  

# 3. What You Must Do After A Loss  

In the event of a loss to any property that may be covered by this   
policy, you must:   
a) promptly give us or our agent notice. Report any theft to the police as soon as possible.   
b) protect the property from further loss. Make any reasonable repairs necessary to protect it. Keep an accurate record of any repair expenses.   
c) separate damaged from undamaged personal property. Give us a detailed list of the damaged, destroyed or stolen property, howing the loss claimed.

e) produce receipts for any increased costs to maintain your standard of living while you reside elsewhere, and records supporting any claim for loss of rental income.   
f) as often as we reasonably require: 1) show us the damaged property. We have a right to reasonable and safe opportunities to view and inspect the loss as often as necessary, unimpeded by actions of you or others, including, but not limited to, civil, governmental or military authorities, that prevent us from viewing and inspecting the loss. We may require you to accompany us when we conduct these activities. 2) at our request, submit to examinations under oath, separately and apart from any other person defined as you or insured person and sign a transcript of the same. 3) produce representatives, employees, members of the insured person's household or others to the extent it is within the insured person's power to do so; and   
g) Upon our request, send to us your signed sworn proof of loss within 91 days of the date of our request. This statement must include the following information: 1) the date, time, location and cause of loss; 2) the interest insured persons and others have in the property, including any encumbrances; 3) any other insurance that may cover the loss; 4) any changes in title, use, occupancy or possession of the property that have occurred during the policy period; 5) at our request, the specifications of any damaged building structure or other structure; 6) the estimated or actual cost to repair or replace the property stolen or damaged by the loss with materials of like kind and quality; 7) the amount you have actually spent to repair or replace the property stolen or damaged by the loss; and 8) in the event that you give us a signed proof of loss, and after submitting that to us, you determine that you want to include a claim for additional damage or loss, you must submit to us a supplemental proof of loss which identifies the amount of the additional loss for each item damaged or stolen.  

![](images/mas41r.jpg)  

We have no duty to provide coverage under this section if you, an insured person, or a representative of either fail to comply with items a) through g) above, and this failure to comply is prejudicial to us.  

B. Item 8, Appraisal, is replaced by the following:  

# 8. Appraisal  

If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either party may   
make written demand for an appraisal. Upon such demand, each   
party shall select a competent and impartial appraiser and notify the   
other of the appraiser’s identity within 20 days after the demand is   
received. The appraisers will select a competent and impartial   
umpire. If the appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire then an   
umpire will be appointed in the following manner:   
a)  You or we will request the American Arbitration Association (AAA) to select an umpire at: American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services Attn: Allstate Texas Appraisal 1101 Laurel Oak Road Ste 100 Voorhees, New Jersey 08043 Email: casefiling@adr.org (with subject matter as “Allstate Texas Appraisal”)   
b) Only if AAA advises you and us in writing that it cannot appoint an umpire may we then jointly request a judge of a district court in the judicial district where the residence premises is located to select an umpire. A judge of a district court does not include a commissioner or a judge of a county court at law, or a justice court, a municipal court, a probate court, or of a commissioner’s court.   
The appraisers shall then determine the amount of the loss, stating   
separately the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item.   
If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to you and   
us, the amount agreed upon shall be the amount of the loss. If they   
cannot agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A   
written award agreed upon by any two will determine the amount of   
the loss. Each party will pay the appraiser it chooses, and equally   
bear expense for the umpire and all other appraisal expenses.   
If the appraisal process is initiated, the appraisal award shall be   
binding on you and us concerning the amount of the loss. We   
reserve the right to deny the appraisal award in part or in its entirety   
based upon the lack of coverage under the policy or failure to satisfy   
policy terms.  

C. Item 13, Action Against Us, is replaced by the following:  

# 13.  Action Against Us  

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, under a coverage to which Section I Conditions applies, unless: a) there has been full compliance with all policy terms; and  

<html><body><table><tr><td>436829585</td></tr><tr><td>June27,2 2024</td></tr></table></body></html>  

b) the action is commenced within two years and one day from the date the cause of action first accrues; and c) in the event that you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss claimed by you, unless you have previously provided to us a signed sworn proof of loss, it is a condition under this Action Against Us provision that no later than 91 days prior to commencing any action against us that we receive from you a signed sworn proof of loss, which contains, to the best of your knowledge and belief, the following information:   
1) the date, time, location and cause of loss;   
2) the interest insured persons and others have in the property, including any encumbrances;   
3) any other insurance that may cover the loss;   
4) any changes in title, use, occupancy or possession of the property that have occurred during the policy period;   
5) at our request, the specifications of any damaged building structure or other structure;   
6) the estimated or actual cost to repair or replace the property stolen or damaged by the loss with materials of like kind and quality;   
7) the amount you have actually spent to repair or replace the property stolen or damaged by the loss; and   
8) in the event that you give us a signed proof of loss, and after submitting that to us, you determine that you want to include a claim for additional damage or loss, you must submit to us a supplemental proof of loss which identifies the amount of the additional loss for each item damaged or stolen. d) If after we receive your proof of loss as described in paragraph c) above, you and we are still not able to agree on the amount of loss, then either party may make a written demand for an appraisal, as described in Section I Conditions, Appraisal. If this demand for appraisal is made before an action is filed against us in a court of competent jurisdiction, then the appraisal must occur before a suit can be filed against us. If the demand for appraisal is made after an action has been filed against us in a court of competent jurisdiction, then the parties agree to ask the court to abate the further proceeding of that action until the appraisal is completed and a determination of the amount of loss is made as described in Section I Conditions, Appraisal.  

To initiate the appraisal process either party must provide written notice of the dispute to the other party and make a written demand for appraisal of the amount of loss.  

The time limit stated in item 13. b) shall be suspended from the date of the first written demand for appraisal until the date of the appraisal award.  

# 19. Mortgagee  

A covered loss will be payable to the mortgagee(s) named on the Policy Declarations, to the extent of their interest and in the order of precedence. All provisions of Section I of this policy apply to these mortgagees.  

# We will:  

a) protect the mortgagee’s interest in a covered building structure in the event of an increase in hazard, intentional or criminal of, or directed by, an insured person, failure by any insured person to take all reasonable steps to save and preserve property after a loss, a change in ownership, or foreclosure if the mortgagee has no knowledge of these conditions; and   
b) give the mortgagee at least 10 days notice if we cancel the policy.  

# The mortgagee will:  

a) furnish proof of loss, upon our request, within 91 days after notice of the loss, if an insured person fails to do so;   
b) pay upon demand any premium due if an insured person fails to do so;   
c) notify us in writing of any change of ownership or occupancy or any increase in hazard of which the mortgagee has knowledge;   
d) give us the mortgagees right of recovery against any party liable for loss; and   
e) after a loss, and at our option, permit us to satisfy the mortgage requirements and receive full transfer of the mortgage.  

If property covered under Dwelling Protection–Coverage A is foreclosed upon under a deed of trust, the mortgagee of that property may cancel this policy at any time by notifying us of the date cancellation is to take effect. We will send the refund, if any, to the mortgagee.  

The mortgagee must credit the refund against any deficiency owed by you and return any amount not credited to you.  

This mortgagee interest provision shall apply to any trustee or loss payee or other secured party.  

# Your Estimated Home Replacement Cost  

Allstate has determined that the estimated cost to replace your home is: \$320,266.  

We based your estimated cost on information provided by you and selected data that was available to us, which is described in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page. Please review all the information in this section to ensure the accuracy of the information used to determine the estimated replacement cost of your home.  

The enclosed Declarations Page shows the limit of liability applicable to Dwelling Protection–Coverage A of your homeowners insurance policy. The estimated replacement cost of your home is the minimum amount for which we will insure your home.  

The decision regarding the limit applicable to your Dwelling Protection–Coverage A is your decision to make, as long as, at a minimum, your limit equals the estimated replacement cost as determined by Allstate and does not exceed maximum coverage limitations established by Allstate.  

It is important to keep in mind that your Coverage A limits reflect a replacement cost that is only an estimate based on data that was available to us when we made this estimate (this information is described in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page). The actual amount it will cost to replace your home cannot be known until after a covered total loss has occurred. Please keep in mind that we do not guarantee the adequacy of the estimate to cover any future loss(es).  

# How Is the Replacement Cost Estimated?  

Many factors can affect the cost to replace your home, including its age, size, and type of construction. For example, the replacement cost uses construction data, such as labor and materials, that are available to us when we made this estimate. This estimate is also based on characteristics of the home, which include information that you provided to us. You might have chosen to insure your home for a higher amount than the estimated replacement cost shown above.  

# Note to Customers Renewing Their Policy  

The estimated replacement cost for your home may have changed since the last time we communicated this information to you. This is because, at renewal, Allstate uses the home characteristics that you have provided to us to recalculate and update the estimated replacement cost. Using updated labor and material rates for your zip code, Allstate takes the home characteristics you have provided and determines the updated estimated replacement cost. The information about your  

home’s characteristics is provided in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page.  

Please note: Your Dwelling information is used to estimate your home replacement cost. It’s important to review and update this information so we’re using the most accurate details to estimate your home’s replacement value.  

If the information about your home shown in your Declarations Page requires any change or if you have any questions or concerns about the information contained in this Important Notice, please contact your Allstate representative, or call us at 1-800-ALLSTATE.

Among the other exclusions, your policy does not provide Dwelling Protection, Other Structures Protection, or Personal Property Protection coverage for loss caused by or consisting of any type of vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, toxic gasses, toxic liquids, toxic solids, waste materials, irritants, contaminants, or pollutants.

# XC7124 Identity Theft Expenses Coverage— Coverage for Identity Theft Victims  

While modern technology has made our lives easier, it has also made it easier for thieves to commit identity theft.  

Thieves begin by gaining access to personal information such as your Social Security Number, date of birth and driver’s license number. They then use this information to set up fake accounts, open loans, rent housing, secure employment or even obtain medical care—all without you even knowing.  

As this crime grows increasingly common, consumers need options for dealing with the costs and hassles related to identity theft—that’s why we’re offering Identity Theft Expenses Coverage.  

# For Just $\pmb{\530}$ per Year, You Can Get Help to Restore Your Good Name  

Now Allstate has a product that can help you if your identity is stolen. You can add this optional coverage to your property policy for just a few dollars a month—a small price to pay for peace of mind—especially when you consider that while other insurance companies typically require a deductible for similar protection, with Allstate there is no deductible.  

# Allstate Takes Identity Theft Expenses Coverage a Step Further  

If you purchase this coverage, we’ll reimburse you for covered expenses you incur to restore your identity up to a $^\mathrm{\oint}\!25,\!000$ coverage limit. That’s more than most companies offer for this type of coverage. This coverage includes reimbursement for:  

Attorneys fees (subject to applicable coverage limits)—in case you need to hire an attorney to defend you if lawsuits are brought against you by merchants or collection agencies, if you need help to remove criminal or civil judgments wrongly entered against you, or to challenge information contained in your credit report.  

Lost wage recovery (up to $\oint\!250.$ /day with a $\mathbb{S}5,000$ cap)—this will help cover wages or salary you may lose if you need to take time off work to complete affidavits or meet with law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, credit grantors, credit reporting agencies or attorneys.  

Loan reapplication fees—this covers your expenses if you need to reapply for loans denied you solely because the lender received incorrect information due to identity theft.  

Other expenses—covers other expenses involved in restoring your identity, such as mailing costs, notary expenses and long-distance phone calls.  

# You Can Get Help If You Become a Victim  

If you become a victim of identity theft, you probably won’t know all that is involved in restoring your name. There are many issues you would need help with, including:  

— Understanding your rights as an identity theft victim.   
— Filling out paperwork, including police reports. Issuing a Fraud Alert to the three major credit bureaus, as well as Social Security Administration, Federal Trade Commission, and U.S. Postal Service. Obtaining copies of your credit bureau reports.   
— Working with the three major credit bureaus to restore the accuracy of your credit history.

# Additional Protection for Your Most Valuable Possessions  

Property insurance covers many belongings, but some items may require higher coverage limits than those in a standard property policy.  

Scheduled Personal Property (SPP) coverage gives you additional protection against loss or damage to your valuables. It’s protection not typically provided with standard property coverage. SPP benefits typically include:  

No deductibles to meet — Coverage for lost or damaged items Coverage for valuables kept in a storage location outside your home  

# Items That May Need the Extra Protection  

SPP coverage provides protection for an array of valuable personal property. Here are some of the items you can protect by purchasing SPP coverage through Allstate:  

Jewelry (including wedding rings and precious or   
semi-precious stones)   
Furs   
Cameras (digital, still, movie, video and related   
equipment)   
Silverware and antiques (including furniture)   
Musical instruments  

— Collections (stamps, coins, music) Fine art works (including paintings, etchings, vases and sculptures) Manuscripts or books Home-office equipment (laptop, computer, audio/visual) Sports equipment (such as golf clubs)  

# Affordable Protection for Your Valuables  

The cost of SPP coverage varies, but the value of your property is the best way to determine how much coverage you need. The rates are generally a small percentage of the total value of the items you’re insuring. This means that your valuables are being protected for only a fraction of the cost.  

# Regularly Review Your SPP Coverage  

Even if you currently have SPP coverage, it’s a good idea to review it annually. It’s possible that the value of your property has changed or that you’ve purchased new items that have not been added to your coverage.  

To learn more about SPP coverage, or if you have any questions about your insurance policy in general, contact your Allstate representative, or visit us at allstate.com.

# What You Should Know About Flood Insurance  

Most homeowners, renters and commercial insurance policies do not provide coverage for flood damage. In fact, protection against floods is generally available only through a separate policy.  

That’s why Allstate is a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and offers standard flood insurance policies.\* A flood insurance policy can help complete the insurance protection for your property and help protect your financial well-being.  

# You May Have More Risk from Flood Than You Think  

Approximately 90 percent of all disasters in the U.S. are flood related. While you may think that it couldn’t happen to you, over 25 percent of all flood losses occur in low- to moderate-risk areas.  

What’s more, flood damage is often accompanied by other damage, such as wind and hail (which is typically covered under a property policy). So if you purchase your NFIP coverage through Allstate, you would have the convenience and peace of mind that comes with working with just one claim adjuster and one agent, instead of two or more for a flood claim.  

# Flood Coverage Is Affordable  

The federal government sets the rates for flood insurance, so there’s typically no difference in rates from policy to policy. You can switch to an NFIP flood insurance policy administered by Allstate for the same amount of premium you may be paying elsewhere. If you choose Allstate, you can have the quality service you’ve come to expect from us.  

Subject to availability and qualifications. Other terms, conditions and exclusions may apply.  

For more information about flood insurance, or if you have any questions about your policy in general, please contact your Allstate representative or visit us at allstate.com.  

\* Allstate provides the standard flood insurance policy under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The standard flood insurance policy is written by Allstate for the National Flood Insurance Program which is administered by the Federal Insurance Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  

# How We Compensate Our Agencies  

The company listed below uses local agencies to assist customers with their insurance decision-making process by providing customers with information and high quality service. These agencies provide numerous services to customers on the company’s behalf.

# Important Information About the Recoupment Charge on Your Declarations Page  

In 2001 the Texas Legislature created the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program to help finance volunteer fire departments across the state with equipment and training.  

In order to cover the costs for this program, Texas law permits the Texas Comptroller to assess charges on insurance  

companies, like Allstate, to fund the Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Fund. The law also allows an insurance company to then recover these assessments by charging their policyholders.  

As a result of this program, a nominal recoupment charge has been added to your premium and is listed on the enclosed Declarations Page. Please note that this charge will also appear on your bill, which will be sent to you soon in a separate mailing.  

If you have questions about any of the information contained in this notice, please contact your Allstate representative.

# Use Of Credit Information Disclosure  

Insurer’s name: Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company  

Address: 2775 Sanders Road Northbrook, IL 60062  

Telephone number: 1-800-ALLSTATE (1-800-255-7828)  

Allstate will obtain and use credit information on you or any other member(s) of your household as a part of the insurance credit scoring process.  

If you have questions regarding this disclosure, contact the insurer at the above address or phone number. For information or other questions, contact the Texas Department of Insurance at 1-800-578-4677 or P.O Box 149104, MC104-PC, Austin, Texas 78714.  

Section 559.053 of the Texas Insurance Code requires an insurer or its agents to disclose to its customers whether credit information will be obtained on the applicant or insured or on any other member(s) of the applicant’s or insured’s household and used as part of the insurance credit scoring process.  

If credit information is obtained or used on the applicant or insured, or on any member of the applicant’s or insured’s household, the insurer shall disclose to the applicant the name of each person on whom credit information was obtained or used and how each person’s credit information was used to underwrite or rate the policy. An insurer may provide this information with this disclosure or in a separate notice.  

Adverse effect means an action taken by an insurer in connection with the underwriting of insurance for a consumer that results in the denial of coverage, the cancellation or  

nonrenewal of coverage, or the offer to and acceptance by a consumer of a policy form, premium rate, or deductible other than the policy form, premium rate, or deductible for which the consumer specifically applied.  

Credit information is any credit related information derived from a credit report itself, or provided in an application for personal insurance. The term does not include information that is not credit-related, regardless of whether the information is contained in a credit report or in an application for insurance coverage or is used to compute a credit score.  

Credit score or insurance score is a number or rating derived from a mathematical formula, computer application, model, or other process that is based on credit information and used to predict the future insurance loss exposure of a consumer.  

# SUMMARY OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS CONTAINED IN CHAPTER 559  

PROHIBITED USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION.  An insurer may not:  

(1) use a credit score that is computed using factors that constitute unfair discrimination;   
(2) deny, cancel, or nonrenew a policy of personal insurance solely on the basis of credit information without consideration of any other applicable underwriting factor independent of credit information; or   
(3) take an action that results in an adverse effect against a consumer because the consumer does not have a credit card account without consideration of any other applicable factor independent of credit information.  

An insurer may not consider an absence of credit information or an inability to determine credit information for an applicant for insurance coverage or insured as a factor in underwriting or rating an insurance policy unless the insurer:  

(1) has statistical, actuarial, or reasonable underwriting information that: (A) is reasonably related to actual or anticipated loss experience; and (B) shows that the absence of credit information could result in actual or anticipated loss differences;   
(2) treats the consumer as if the applicant for insurance coverage or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer; or   
(3) excludes the use of credit information as a factor in underwriting and uses only other underwriting criteria.  

NEGATIVE FACTORS. An insurer may not use any of the following as a negative factor in any credit scoring  

methodology or in reviewing credit information to underwrite or rate a policy of personal insurance:  

(1) a credit inquiry that is not initiated by the consumer;   
(2) an inquiry relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer’s credit report; or   
(3) a collection account with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer’s credit report.  

Multiple lender inquiries made within 30 days of a prior inquiry, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s credit report as from the home mortgage or motor vehicle lending industry, shall be considered by an insurer as only one inquiry.  

EFFECT OF EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS.  An insurer shall, on written request from an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured, provide reasonable exceptions to the insurer’s rates, rating classifications, or underwriting rules for a consumer whose credit information has been directly influenced by a catastrophic illness or injury, by the death of a spouse, child, or parent, by temporary loss of employment, by divorce, or by identity theft. In such a case, the insurer may consider only credit information not affected by the event or shall assign a neutral credit score.  

An insurer may require reasonable written and independently verifiable documentation of the event and the effect of the event on the person’s credit before granting an exception. An insurer is not required to consider repeated events or events the insurer reconsidered previously as an extraordinary event.  

An insurer may also consider granting an exception to an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured for an extraordinary event not listed in this section. An insurer is not out of compliance with any law or rule relating to underwriting, rating, or rate filing as a result of granting an exception under this article.  

NOTICE OF ACTION RESULTING IN ADVERSE EFFECT.  If an insurer takes an action resulting in an adverse effect with respect to an applicant for insurance coverage or insured based in whole or in part on information contained in a credit report, the insurer must provide to the applicant or insured within 30 days certain information regarding how an applicant or insured may verify and dispute information contained in a credit report.  

DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ERROR CORRECTION.  If it is determined through the dispute resolution process established under Section 611(a)(5), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1681i), as amended, that the credit information of a current insured was inaccurate or incomplete or could not be verified and the insurer receives notice of that determination from the consumer reporting agency or from the insured, the insurer shall re-underwrite and re-rate the insured not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt of the notice.  

After re-underwriting or re-rating the insured, the insurer shall make any adjustments necessary within 30 days, consistent with the insurer’s underwriting and rating guidelines. If an insurer determines that the insured has overpaid premium, the insurer shall credit the amount of overpayment. The insurer shall compute the overpayment back to the shorter of the last 12 months of coverage; or the actual policy period.

— Involuntary Unemployment   
— Catastrophic Medical Expense   
— Medical Crisis   
— Care of Adult Dependent   
— Identity Theft Serious or Catastrophic Long-term Injury, Illness or Disability

# Your Next Steps

# You’re Receiving the Responsible Payment Discount  

As an added benefit of being an Allstate customer, you’re receiving our Responsible Payment Discount on your House & Home policy.  

Here’s how the Responsible Payment Discount works. From this point on, you will continue to receive this discount:  

— If you pay your premium in full. If you pay your premium through a third party (e.g., escrow). If we do not send you a cancellation notice for nonpayment of premium (the billing notice we send when we don’t receive your payment on time). If we send you a cancellation notice for nonpayment of premium and your policy renews, the discount will be reduced at renewal, which may cause your overall insurance premium to increase. If this discount is reduced because of a cancellation notice, we will add it back to your policy at renewal if no cancellation notices for nonpayment of premium have been sent to you within the most recent twelve-month period ending 45 days prior to your renewal effective date.  

# Payment Options to Help You Save Money  

We want you to continue saving money with the Responsible Payment Discount, so we offer several ways to make paying your bills fast and easy.  

You can sign up for the Allstate® Easy Pay Plan, which allows us to deduct your insurance premiums each month, or in full, from your checking account. You’ll save on  

postage, have fewer checks to write, and have the monthly installment fee reduced.   
You can also pay your premium over the phone with either a check or credit card. Simply call us toll-free at   
1-800-ALLSTATE. You’ll be asked for your policy number when you pay by phone, so it’s a good idea to have your policy documents in hand before you call.   
You can set up an escrow account to ensure your   
premiums are paid on time. (Please contact your mortgage lender for more information on setting up an escrow   
account.)  

You can choose to pay your premium in full.  

Have Questions? Please Contact Us If you have any questions about the Responsible Payment Discount, or if you’d like more information about the different bill paying options available to you, please contact your Allstate representative, or call us toll-free at 1-800-ALLSTATE.

# Your Property Policy Includes a Tropical Cyclone Deductible and a Windstorm and Hail Deductible  

The following is a summary of the Tropical Cyclone and Windstorm and Hail Deductibles. Please note that this is only a summary and is not a part of your policy. For detailed information about the coverage provided by your policy, please read the policy, including the Declarations Page, the Tropical Cyclone Deductible Endorsement, the Windstorm and Hail Deductible Endorsement and any other applicable endorsements. If you have any questions regarding the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the deductible options available to you or your insurance coverage in general, please contact your Allstate representative.  

# When does the “Tropical Cyclone Deductible” apply?  

The Tropical Cyclone Deductible is a separate deductible that applies in the event of covered loss “caused by tropical cyclone or by any object(s) driven by tropical cyclone.”  

For the purpose of the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, we've defined “tropical cyclone” as “a hurricane, a tropical storm, or any wind, hail, rain, snow, or sleet accompanying a hurricane or a tropical storm.”  

If another deductible applicable to the loss exceeds the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the greater deductible will apply. “Please refer to the Tropical Cyclone Deductible Endorsement for other applicable definitions and provisions.”  

# When does the “Windstorm and Hail Deductible” apply?  

The Windstorm and Hail Deductible is a separate deductible that applies for sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by windstorm or hail to covered property when the Tropical Cyclone Deductible does not apply. This is the total amount of deductible for any one loss due to windstorm or hail.  

If another deductible applicable to the loss exceeds the Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the greater deductible will apply. “Please refer to the Windstorm and Hail Deductible Endorsement for other applicable definitions and provisions.”  

# What are the amounts of the “Tropical Cyclone Deductible” and “Windstorm and Hail Deductible” and how are they calculated?  

Your Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm and Hail Deductible amounts appear on the enclosed Policy Declarations. When the Tropical Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail Deductible applies, we will pay for a covered loss only when the amount of that loss exceeds that deductible amount shown on the Declarations Page (subject to applicable policy terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions). We will then pay only the excess amount.  

The following example illustrates how the Tropical Cyclone Deductible and the Windstorm and Hail Deductible are calculated when percentage deductibles are applicable. The amounts of your Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm and Hail Deductible would be based upon a percentage of your Dwelling Protection coverage limit. If your Dwelling Protection coverage limit is $^{\oint100,000}$ and you have a $5\%$ Tropical Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail Deductible, your Tropical Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail Deductible amount would be $^{85,000(.05\times\mathcal{5}100,000)}$ . If the covered loss is not caused by a tropical cyclone or wind or hail, the All Other Peril Deductible listed on your Declarations Page will apply.  

You may have the option to reduce your policy premium by choosing a higher deductible. Please keep in mind that if you choose a higher deductible, your premium may decrease, however, the amount we pay you for a covered loss will be less when the deductible applies. Your Allstate representative can discuss your options with you.  

If a percentage deductible applies to your Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm and Hail Deductible, it is calculated as a percentage of your Dwelling Protection coverage limit, your deductible amount will change accordingly if your Dwelling Protection coverage limit changes for any reason, including, for example:  

— you change your Dwelling Protection coverage limit; or due to the application of the policy’s Property Insurance Adjustment provision, if applicable, which may automatically increase your Dwelling Protection coverage limit as described in the policy.  

Further details regarding these deductibles can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Deductible Endorsement and the Windstorm and Hail Deductible Endorsement. Again, if you have any questions regarding the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the deductible options available to you or your insurance coverage in general, please contact your Allstate representative.  

# Important Information About Your Credit-Based Insurance Score  

Please take a moment to read the notice immediately following this insert containing important information about our use of consumer reports and your rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. In that notice, we explain why we order credit reports and explain how important it is for you to check the accuracy of that information.  

In the state where we issued your policy we are required by law to inform you of certain factors in your credit report(s) adversely affecting your credit-based insurance score. The most significant of these factors are:  

The average number of months that accounts are listed on the credit report: Generally, the longer your average age of accounts, the more favorable your insurance score will be. Those with the most favorable insurance scores often have an average age of accounts of 16 years or longer.  

The number of months since the most recent delinquent payment: A delinquent payment is one made over 30 days late. Delinquent payments within the past five years may have an adverse effect on an insurance score and the more recent the delinquency, the greater the adverse effect. Please note that over time the impact of this type of delinquency on your insurance score will decrease and even disappear if there are no new delinquencies. Avoiding future delinquencies may benefit your insurance score.  

The presence of a collection within the past five years: When we refer to a "collection," this could include collections that were previously paid off or collections on closed accounts. We exclude medical collections that are identified as such. Those with the most favorable insurance scores will typically have no collections on their credit report. Avoiding future collections may lead to a more favorable insurance score.  

The presence of a derogatory item within the past five years:  A derogatory item may include a delinquency, a collection, or a derogatory public record, such as a bankruptcy, judgment, lien, repossession, or foreclosure. Avoiding derogatory items in the future may lead to a more favorable insurance score.

# Consumer Report Information and Its Impact on Your Insurance  

Many factors play a role in determining your insurance premium. Among the factors we consider are the following: where you live, the coverages and limits you’ve chosen and discount eligibility. In addition, we use consumer reporting agency information for eligibility and rating purposes. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to inform you when we take adverse action based on a consumer report.  

As permitted by law, we ordered credit report information about you and your spouse, who are both named insureds on the policy.  

Based in whole or in part on the information provided to us by the credit reporting agency listed below, Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company is unable to offer you a lower rate: based on the credit information available to us.  

# You May Request a Free Credit Report  

Under Section 612 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have the right to obtain a free copy of your consumer report from the consumer reporting agency listed below if you request it within 60 days of receiving this notice (even if the report did not contain any information regarding credit status). You also have the right, under Section 611 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to dispute with the consumer reporting agency listed below the accuracy or completeness of any information in any report(s) furnished by the agency.

Please keep in mind that the consumer reporting agency did not make the decision to take this adverse action and will not be able to provide you with any specific reasons regarding why we took this action. Also, any changes to your name or address within the past two years can affect the completeness of your report. If your information has changed, please let your insurance representative know.  

# Have Questions? Please Contact Your Allstate Representative  

We hope you will take advantage of these rights and help us give you the lowest premium we can provide. If you have any questions about the information contained in this notice, or about your insurance in general, please contact your insurance representative.  

# The Connection Between Credit History and Premium  

We determine premiums using the information you provide on your insurance application, as well as using other factors. Certain credit report information has proved an effective predictor of insurance losses. It also allows us to keep costs competitive by helping make it possible for customers who are less likely to experience losses to pay less for their insurance. Keep in mind we use credit history in addition to, not instead of, our other characteristics. By considering this information, we can match likelihood of loss to premium even more precisely, and we think that’s good for our customers. It allows us to keep insurance costs as competitive as possible for the greatest number of policyholders. You can also learn more about our use of credit information, including ways you may be able to improve your insurance score, by visiting allstate.com.  

In states which have laws that provide couples entering into civil unions, domestic partnerships, or similar relationships the benefits, protections and responsibilities under law as are granted to spouses in a marriage in this state, the term "spouse" in this notice includes civil partners, domestic partners or any similar relationship recognized by the laws of this state.  

Please keep in mind that the consumer reporting agency(ies) did not make the decision to take this adverse action and will not be able to provide you with any specific reasons regarding why we took this action. Also, any changes to your name or address within the past two years can affect the completeness of your file with the consumer reporting agency(ies). If your information has changed, please let your insurance representative know.  

Under Section 612 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have the right to obtain a free copy of your report(s) provided to us by the consumer reporting agency listed below if you request it within 60 days of receiving this notice.

# Consumer Report Information and Its Impact on Your Insurance  

In an effort to keep insurance costs as competitive as possible for the greatest number of policyholders, we may consider certain prior insurance information, prior insurance loss information, driving information and motor vehicle reports (MVR), when determining our customers’ eligibility, premiums and payment options.

# What You Should Know When You File a Claim

Within 15 business days after they get all the information they need: The company must approve or deny your claim in writing. They can extend this deadline up to 45 days from the date they: (a) let you know they need more time and (b) tell you why. Within 5 business days after they let you know your claim is approved: The company must pay the claim. Note: TDI can extend these deadlines by 15 more days if there is a weather-related catastrophe.  

If your company fails to meet these deadlines, you may be able to collect the claim amount, interest, and attorney’s fees.  

6.  Written explanation of claim denial. Your insurance company must tell you in writing why your claim or part of your claim was denied.

However, they cannot ask for your federal income tax returns unless: (a) they get a court order or (b) your claim involves a fire loss, loss of profits, or lost income.
