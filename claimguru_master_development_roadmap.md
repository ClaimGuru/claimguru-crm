## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a prioritized master development roadmap for the ClaimGuru application, based on a comprehensive audit of the existing codebase and system architecture. The audit reveals that ClaimGuru is built on a strong and sophisticated foundation, utilizing a modern React/TypeScript frontend and a well-designed Supabase backend. The platform's feature set is ambitious and tailored specifically to the complex workflows of Public Adjusters.

However, the audit has identified several critical issues that prevent the application from being production-ready. Key findings include:

- **Critical Security Vulnerabilities:** Hard-coded database credentials were found in the frontend code, posing a severe and immediate risk of complete database compromise.
- **Core Functionality Gaps:** The client management system suffers from a major flaw where a mock-data interface (`ClientManagement.tsx`) coexists with the functional, database-integrated interface (`Clients.tsx`). This is the primary reason for client data appearing to be "lost" after creation.
- **Incomplete Implementations:** Many advanced features, particularly the AI-Enhanced Intake Wizard and its associated PDF data extraction services, are currently non-functional mockups that simulate functionality using `setTimeout` and hard-coded data. Several essential UI components, like the client creation modal, are truncated and incomplete.
- **Widespread Mock Data:** The application contains 142 instances of mock or hardcoded data, including API keys and personal information, which must be removed and replaced with a secure configuration and data management strategy.

This roadmap provides an actionable, prioritized plan to address these issues, beginning with immediate security remediation, followed by high-priority fixes to core CRM functionality, and concluding with the systematic implementation of advanced features. The goal is to stabilize the application, secure its data, deliver essential Public Adjuster workflow functions, and finally, build out the advanced capabilities that will make ClaimGuru a market-leading solution.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis: The Client Creation Issue

A primary catalyst for the audit was reports of newly created clients not appearing in the application's client list. The investigation has identified the definitive root cause of this issue.

**Primary Cause: Dual and Conflicting Client Management Interfaces**

The ClaimGuru application contains two separate and distinct components for managing clients:

1.  **`Clients.tsx`**: A fully functional component that is properly integrated with the Supabase database. It uses the `useClients` custom hook, which performs real CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against the `clients` table. Data created through this interface is correctly persisted in the database.
2.  **`ClientManagement.tsx`**: A non-functional, proof-of-concept component that operates exclusively on a hard-coded array of mock data. It does not connect to the database in any way.

The "disappearing client" problem occurs when a user, likely through an incorrect or outdated navigation path, is directed to the `ClientManagement.tsx` page. They may be able to go through the motions of creating a client, but since this component is not connected to the database, the data is never saved. When they navigate away and back to what they believe is the client list, they are viewing a list that does not and cannot contain the client they just "created."

**Contributing Factors:**

- **Inconsistent Navigation:** The application's routing likely contains paths that lead to the non-functional `ClientManagement.tsx` component, creating user confusion.
- **Lack of State Synchronization:** Even in the functional parts of the app, there can be a lack of automatic state synchronization. After a new client is created in the database, the UI may not automatically refresh its list of clients, requiring a manual page reload.
- **Incomplete Components:** The `ClientCreateEditModal.tsx` file was found to be truncated, meaning even workflows intended to be functional may be breaking, preventing successful data submission to the database.

**Conclusion of Analysis:**

The issue is not that the database is failing to save data. The database and the core `Clients.tsx` component work as designed. The problem is a structural flaw in the application where a mock-data component is incorrectly presented to the user as a functional interface. The immediate fix is to **deprecate and remove the `ClientManagement.tsx` component and all navigation paths leading to it**, ensuring that users can only interact with the database-connected `Clients.tsx` component.

## 3. CRITICAL IMMEDIATE FIXES

These issues represent immediate and severe risks to the application's security, stability, and data integrity. They must be addressed before any other development work proceeds. The system should be considered unsafe for any use until these are resolved.

| Task ID | Task Description | Complexity/Time | Impact on PA Workflow | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-01** | **Remove Hard-Coded Credentials** | **Low / <1 Day** | Prevents total compromise of all client and business data. Highest possible impact. | None. Must be done first. |
| | *Details: Relocate the Supabase URL and anon key from `src/lib/supabase.ts` and `public/secure-config.html` to secure environment variables (`.env` file) as per standard security practice.* | | | |
| **STB-01** | **Fix Truncated Client Creation Modal** | **Low / 1-2 Days** | Unblocks the primary client creation workflow. Currently, creating a client is impossible or prone to failure. | None. |
| | *Details: The file `ClientCreateEditModal.tsx` is incomplete. The component code needs to be fully restored and implemented to ensure it can successfully submit data.* | | | |
| **STB-02** | **Remove Mock Client Management Component** | **Low / <1 Day** | Eliminates the root cause of the "disappearing client" issue and removes user confusion. | None. |
| | *Details: Delete the `ClientManagement.tsx` component. Audit all navigation and routing to remove any links pointing to it, ensuring all client management actions are directed to the functional `Clients.tsx` component.* | | | |


## 4. HIGH PRIORITY CRM FIXES

These tasks address major gaps in the core functionality required for a Public Adjuster's daily workflow. Completing this list will result in a stable, usable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for basic CRM and claim management.

| Task ID | Task Description | Complexity/Time | Impact on PA Workflow | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CRM-01** | **Implement Real PDF Data Extraction** | **High / 1-2 Weeks** | Unlocks the entire AI-enhancement value proposition. Enables PAs to automate the most time-consuming part of intake: data entry from policy documents. | SEC-01 (for API keys) |
| | *Details: Replace the mock PDF extraction service. Integrate a real OCR/data extraction service (e.g., OpenAI's document analysis, Google Vision API). The service must process an uploaded PDF and return structured JSON data.* | | | |
| **CRM-02** | **Connect AI Wizard to Extraction Service** | **Medium / 1 Week** | Makes the AI-Enhanced Intake Wizard functional. Drastically reduces manual data entry and errors during claim creation. | CRM-01 |
