# ✅ PDF EXTRACTION ISSUE FIXED

## Problem Solved
- **REMOVED** the fake data generation from `RealTimePolicyUploadStep.tsx`
- **REPLACED** with `ActualPDFExtractionStep.tsx` that extracts REAL data from ANY PDF file
- **NO MORE** "DYNAMIC EXTRACTION INSURANCE CO" or fake addresses

## What Was Fixed
1. **Real PDF Text Extraction** - Now reads actual content from uploaded PDFs
2. **Intelligent Data Parsing** - Extracts policy numbers, names, addresses, dates from real text
3. **File Recognition** - Recognizes and processes different types of policy documents
4. **Confidence Scoring** - Shows how much data was successfully extracted
5. **User Confirmation** - Allows review and confirmation of extracted data

## Deployment
**URL**: https://4wyitdk0a3.space.minimax.io

## Testing Steps
1. Go to **Claims** → **AI-Enhanced Intake Wizard**
2. First step: **"ACTUAL PDF Data Extraction"** (green header)
3. Upload ANY PDF file (Certified Copy Policy.pdf, Delabano files, etc.)
4. Click **"Extract REAL Data"**
5. Review the extracted information
6. Click **"Confirm & Save Data"**

## Expected Results
- **Real policy numbers** extracted from your PDF
- **Actual insured names** from the document
- **Real insurance company names** 
- **Actual property addresses**
- **Real dates and coverage amounts**

The fake data generation has been completely removed and replaced with actual PDF content extraction.
