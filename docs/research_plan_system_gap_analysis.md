# ClaimGuru System Gap Analysis Research Plan

## Objective
Perform a comprehensive gap analysis comparing the current ClaimGuru implementation against the user's development phase requirements to provide an accurate assessment of what's implemented, what's partial, and what's missing.

## Research Questions
1. Which features from the phase requirements are fully implemented?
2. Which features are partially implemented and need completion?
3. Which features are completely missing?
4. Are there any misalignments between current implementation and requirements?

## Methodology
1. **Review Current Implementation Status**
   - Analyze all system analysis reports (database, frontend, functions, architecture)
   - Catalog all implemented features and their completion status
   
2. **Extract Phase Requirements**
   - Identify all phase requirements from todo documents
   - Categorize requirements by functional area
   - Map requirements to current implementation
   
3. **Perform Gap Analysis**
   - Compare requirements against implementation
   - Classify each requirement as: Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Missing, Misaligned
   - Provide specific evidence from analysis reports
   
4. **Generate Comprehensive Report**
   - Detailed breakdown by category
   - Specific recommendations for completion
   - Prioritization based on business impact

## Key Sources to Analyze

- database_schema_analysis_report.md
- supabase_functions_analysis.md
- frontend_components_inventory.md
- components_detailed_analysis.md
- wizard_components_analysis.md
- user_input_files/todo.md (main requirements)
- todo_docx_converted.md
- prioritized_todo_highest_to_lowest.md

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive gap analysis report
- Feature implementation matrix
- Specific recommendations for completion
- Priority-based development roadmap
