# Financial Management and Accounting Integration Capabilities Review

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive evaluation examines the current state of financial management and accounting integration capabilities across eight critical areas for professional services practices, with particular focus on legal practices. The analysis reveals significant advancement in 2025 solutions, with mature trust accounting compliance, sophisticated billing automation, and robust integration capabilities with major accounting platforms.
