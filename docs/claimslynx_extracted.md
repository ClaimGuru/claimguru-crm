ClaimsLynk

> The following outline details the processes that streamline and
> automate workflow processes by utilizing SystemsLynk Software
> Solutions & Applications for the CMS (Claims Management Systems) of
> the Public Insurance Adjusting Industry. This cloud-based software
> will be hosted through a cloud-based system like AWS EC2 (Amazon Web
> Services). The system will duplicate the functionality of a competing
> web-based software, ClaimWizard.com. The following outlines the
> changes and additional functionality that will be involved with
> ClaimsLynk to make it stand apart from its competitor.

**There are following modules of the system**.

> ∙ Administrator Module-software owner level security-this allows the
> assigning of the software to the clients on different paid tiers of
> functionality access.
>
> ∙ Clients-software subscriber administration level security-the
> clients are able to access the level of functionality included in
> their subscription and are able to control the users of their
> organizations access level however; the client cannot add users. Users
> have to be added by the administration.
>
> ∙ User Module-software subscriber's personnel level security-users are
> assigned by the client for their particular organization and are
> assigned specific levels of access by the client ∙ Office Staff
> Module-software subscriber's office staff level security-users are
> assigned by the client as office staff and cannot be assigned specific
> "paid subscription" task i.e. individual claim assignments
>
> ∙ Consumer Module-software subscriber's clientele-this refers to the
> "client" of the software subscriber.
>
> **Mobile Functionality:** ClaimsLynk will be the exact opposite of its
> competitor ClaimWizard in that it will focus on the functionality
> being mobile 1^st^ and desktop access 2^nd^. The mobile applications
> will need to be able to run on both android and iOS based phones and
> tablets. The software will allow for desktop access through a
> web-based cloud service with the same full functionality so that
> office staff is able to manage and complete task.
>
> **Software Owner Dashboard:** The structure and design of the backend
> dashboard is to be determined by the developer.
>
> **Functional Requirements**: All the activities of the entire system
> from registration to logout will be include under functional
> requirements except security. In the functional requirement they will
> be following activities:
>
> ∙ Registration
>
> ∙ Login
>
> ∙ Add Client
>
> ∙ Document creation
