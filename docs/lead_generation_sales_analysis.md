## 2. Detailed Capability Analysis

### 2.1 Embeddable Lead Capture Forms for Websites/Social Media

**Current State Analysis:**
Lead capture forms remain the primary gateway for prospect engagement, with best practices emphasizing balance between conversion rate and lead quality[1]. Modern implementations focus on strategic placement, field optimization, and seamless integration across digital touchpoints.

**Best Practices Identified:**
- **Field Optimization**: Use only essential fields initially, employing multi-step forms to progressively collect detailed information while maintaining high conversion rates[1]
- **Strategic Placement**: Position forms above the fold on homepages, utilize pop-up forms for specific offers, and integrate alongside primary attention-grabbers like videos[1]  
- **Design Principles**: Maintain simple, brand-aligned designs with clear value propositions and directional elements guiding visitors toward form completion[1]
- **Embeddable Technology**: Leverage dedicated form builders rather than hard-coded solutions, ensuring compatibility across websites and social media platforms[1]

**Implementation Gaps:**
