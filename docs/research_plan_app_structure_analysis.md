# ClaimGuru Application Structure Analysis - Research Plan

## Task Overview
Analyze the ClaimGuru application structure by examining all pages, components, and routes. Document the complete navigation structure, identify all pages and their purposes, and map out the user flow for Public Adjusters.

## Research Objectives
1. **Complete Navigation Structure**: Document all routes and navigation paths
2. **Page Identification**: Catalog all pages and their specific purposes
3. **Component Analysis**: Examine reusable components and their relationships
4. **User Flow Mapping**: Specifically focus on Public Adjuster user journeys
5. **Architecture Documentation**: Document the overall application architecture

## Research Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Application Structure Analysis
- [x] 1.1: Examine main application entry points (App.tsx, main.tsx, package.json)
- [x] 1.2: Analyze routing configuration and navigation structure
- [x] 1.3: Document project dependencies and build configuration

### Phase 2: Pages Analysis  
- [x] 2.1: Catalog all pages in src/pages/ directory
- [x] 2.2: Analyze each page's purpose and functionality
- [x] 2.3: Identify page-specific components and layouts
- [x] 2.4: Document data flow and state management patterns

### Phase 3: Components Analysis
- [x] 3.1: Examine all reusable components in src/components/
- [x] 3.2: Document component hierarchy and relationships
- [x] 3.3: Identify shared UI patterns and design system elements
- [x] 3.4: Analyze component props and interfaces

### Phase 4: Navigation & Routing Deep Dive
- [x] 4.1: Map complete route structure and nested routes
- [x] 4.2: Document navigation components (sidebars, headers, breadcrumbs)
- [x] 4.3: Analyze route guards and authentication flows
- [x] 4.4: Identify dynamic routing patterns

### Phase 5: Public Adjuster User Flow Analysis
- [x] 5.1: Trace typical Public Adjuster workflows
- [x] 5.2: Document claim intake and processing flows
- [x] 5.3: Map client management workflows
- [x] 5.4: Analyze document management and AI integration flows

### Phase 6: Technical Architecture Analysis
- [x] 6.1: Document state management patterns (contexts, hooks)
- [x] 6.2: Analyze service layer and API integrations
- [x] 6.3: Examine utility functions and helper modules
- [x] 6.4: Document configuration and environment setup

### Phase 7: Integration Points Analysis
- [x] 7.1: Identify external service integrations
- [x] 7.2: Document database integration patterns
- [x] 7.3: Analyze authentication and authorization systems
- [x] 7.4: Map file upload and document processing workflows

### Phase 8: Report Generation
- [x] 8.1: Synthesize findings into comprehensive analysis document
- [x] 8.2: Create visual diagrams for user flows and navigation structure
- [x] 8.3: Document recommendations and architectural insights
- [x] 8.4: Final review and completion verification

## Expected Deliverables
1. Complete application structure analysis document
2. Navigation flow diagrams
3. Component relationship mappings
4. Public Adjuster user journey documentation
5. Technical architecture overview

## Success Criteria
- Every page, component, and route documented
- Clear understanding of Public Adjuster workflows
- Complete navigation structure mapped
- Technical architecture patterns identified
- Actionable insights for development teams

## Timeline
Estimated completion: 2-3 hours for comprehensive analysis
