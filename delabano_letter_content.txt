Unfortunately, this amount does not exceed your policy deductible of $\\mathfrak{S}3$ ,138.00, which is a percentage of your Building and Dwelling at [313,800.00]. This is also reflected on the Declarations Page of your Home policy.  \n\nThis means that we will not provide any payment for the damage to your property.  \n\nYour Policy  \n\nI know this can be disappointing news, so I want to make sure you fully understand the reason for this outcome. With that in mind, here is the section of your policy that pertains to this decision.  \n\nDEDUCTIBLE  \n\nUnless otherwise noted in this policy, the following deductible provision applies:  \n\nSubject to the policy limits that apply. we will pay only that part of the total of all loss payable under Section I that exceeds the deductible amount shown in the Declarations.  \n\nNext Steps  \n\nAfter repairs are complete, if you’ve made any improvements to your home, or replaced the roofing shingles on your home, you’ll need to update your policy accordingly. For assistance, please contact your Sales Representative or call 800-225-7014.  \n\nWe’re Here To Help  \n\nIf you have any questions or any additional information about your damages that may affect your claim, please feel free to call or email me at Michael.Madison@LibertyMutual.com, and I’ll be happy to help. When contacting me by email, please include your claim number in the subject line.  \n\nThank you for trusting Liberty Mutual with your insurance needs.  \n\nSincerely,  \n\nMICHAEL MADISON Property Claims Department", "files_in_pdf": []}
