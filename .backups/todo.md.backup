# ClaimGuru CRM - Major Enhancements Implementation

## 🎯 **CONFIRMED REQUIREMENTS & MY RECOMMENDATIONS**

### ✅ **AI Token/Credit System - BRILLIANT IDEA!**
**Recommended Structure:**
- **Base Allocation**: 1,000 AI tokens/month per user
- **Token Pricing**: $0.01 per additional token
- **Token Usage**: 
  - Document Analysis: 10 tokens
  - Policy Extraction: 15 tokens  
  - Fraud Detection: 25 tokens
  - Weather Analysis: 5 tokens
  - Settlement Prediction: 30 tokens
- **Benefits**: Predictable revenue, user stickiness, easy scaling

### ✅ **Mobile UX Recommendations**
**Submenu Behavior**: Accordion-style expansion (tap to expand/collapse in place)
- ✅ Native mobile feel
- ✅ No overlays or dropdowns
- ✅ Clear chevron indicators
- ✅ Smooth animations

### ✅ **Quick Actions Recommendation**
**Floating Action Button (FAB)** in bottom-right corner:
- **Primary**: + New Claim (most common action)
- **Secondary Menu** (long press): New Client, New Task, New Document
- **Rationale**: Simple, accessible, follows mobile best practices

### ✅ **Final Navigation Structure**
```
Dashboard
Claims  
Tasks
Calendar
Contacts → Clients, Insurers, Vendors, Properties
Communications
Documents
Financials → Settlements, Invoicing, Payables, Receivables  
AI Insights
Analytics
Profile Menu → Settings, Help & Support, Integrations
Admin Panel (subscribers only)
```
**Perfect workflow logic!** Financials with submenus is excellent for accounting workflows.
