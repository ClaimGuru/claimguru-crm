The rates in effect at the beginning of your current policy period will be used to calculate any change in your premium.  \n\nPolicy Transfer  \n\nYou may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent.  \n\nContinued Coverage After Your Death  \n\nIf you die, coverage will continue until the end of the current policy period for:   \n1. your legal representative while acting as such, but only with respect to the residence premises and property covered under this policy on the date of your death.   \n2. an insured person, and any person having proper temporary custody of your property until a legal representative is appointed and qualified.  \n\nDividend Provision  \n\nTo the extent and upon the conditions fixed and determined from time to time by our Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of the Texas Insurance Code of 1951, as amended, you shall be entitled to participate in a distribution of our surplus.  \n\nCancellation  \n\n1.

The amount payable under Building Structure Reimbursement described above does not include the value of any land associated with the replacement structure(s).  \n\nBuilding Structure Reimbursement payment will be limited to the difference between any actual cash value payment made for the covered loss to building structures and the smallest of 1), 2) or 3) above.  \n\nBuilding Structure Reimbursement will not apply to:  \n\n1) property covered under Personal Property Protection– Coverage C;   \n2) property covered under Other Structures Protection– Coverage B that is not a building structure;   \n3) wall-to-wall carpeting, fences, awnings and outdoor antennas, whether or not fastened to a building structure;   \n4) roof surface(s) when the loss is caused by windstorm or hail; or   \n5) land.  \n\nPayment under a), b) or c) above will not include any increased cost due to the enforcement of building codes, ordinances or laws regulating or requiring the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of building structures or other structures.  \n\nd)  Personal Property Reimbursement.

Upon such demand, each party must select a competent and impartial appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser's identity within 20 days after the demand is received. The appraisers will select a competent and impartial umpire. If the appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we can ask a judge of a court of record in the state where the residence premises is located to select an umpire.  \n\nThe appraisers shall then determine the amount of loss, stating separately the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to you and to us, the amount agreed upon shall be the amount of loss. If they cannot agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A written award agreed upon by any two will determine the amount of loss.  \n\nEach party will pay the appraiser it chooses, and equally bear expenses for the umpire and all other appraisal expenses.  \n\n9.

We   \nreserve the right to deny the appraisal award in part or in its entirety   \nbased upon the lack of coverage under the policy or failure to satisfy   \npolicy terms.  \n\nC.

Action Against Us  \n\nNo one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, under a coverage to which Section I Conditions applies, unless: a) there has been full compliance with all policy terms; and  \n\n436829585June27,2 2024  \n\nb) the action is commenced within two years and one day from the date the cause of action first accrues; and c) in the event that you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss claimed by you, unless you have previously provided to us a signed sworn proof of loss, it is a condition under this Action Against Us provision that no later than 91 days prior to commencing any action against us that we receive from you a signed sworn proof of loss, which contains, to the best of your knowledge and belief, the following information:   \n1) the date, time, location and cause of loss;   \n2) the interest insured persons and others have in the property, including any encumbrances;   \n3) any other insurance that may cover the loss;   \n4) any changes in title, use, occupancy or possession of the property that have occurred during the policy period;   \n5) at our request, the specifications of any damaged building structure or other structure;   \n6) the estimated or actual cost to repair or replace the property stolen or damaged by the loss with materials of like kind and quality;   \n7) the amount you have actually spent to repair or replace the property stolen or damaged by the loss; and   \n8) in the event that you give us a signed proof of loss, and after submitting that to us, you determine that you want to include a claim for additional damage or loss, you must submit to us a supplemental proof of loss which identifies the amount of the additional loss for each item damaged or stolen. d) If after we receive your proof of loss as described in paragraph c) above, you and we are still not able to agree on the amount of loss, then either party may make a written demand for an appraisal, as described in Section I Conditions, Appraisal. If this demand for appraisal is made before an action is filed against us in a court of competent jurisdiction, then the appraisal must occur before a suit can be filed against us. If the demand for appraisal is made after an action has been filed against us in a court of competent jurisdiction, then the parties agree to ask the court to abate the further proceeding of that action until the appraisal is completed and a determination of the amount of loss is made as described in Section I Conditions, Appraisal.  \n\nTo initiate the appraisal process either party must provide written notice of the dispute to the other party and make a written demand for appraisal of the amount of loss.  \n\nThe time limit stated in item 13. b) shall be suspended from the date of the first written demand for appraisal until the date of the appraisal award.  \n\n19. Mortgagee  \n\nA covered loss will be payable to the mortgagee(s) named on the Policy Declarations, to the extent of their interest and in the order of precedence. All provisions of Section I of this policy apply to these mortgagees.  \n\nWe will:  \n\na) protect the mortgagee’s interest in a covered building structure in the event of an increase in hazard, intentional or criminal of, or directed by, an insured person, failure by any insured person to take all reasonable steps to save and preserve property after a loss, a change in ownership, or foreclosure if the mortgagee has no knowledge of these conditions; and   \nb) give the mortgagee at least 10 days notice if we cancel the policy.  \n\nThe mortgagee will:  \n\na) furnish proof of loss, upon our request, within 91 days after notice of the loss, if an insured person fails to do so;   \nb) pay upon demand any premium due if an insured person fails to do so;   \nc) notify us in writing of any change of ownership or occupancy or any increase in hazard of which the mortgagee has knowledge;   \nd) give us the mortgagees right of recovery against any party liable for loss; and   \ne) after a loss, and at our option, permit us to satisfy the mortgage requirements and receive full transfer of the mortgage.  \n\nIf property covered under Dwelling Protection–Coverage A is foreclosed upon under a deed of trust, the mortgagee of that property may cancel this policy at any time by notifying us of the date cancellation is to take effect. We will send the refund, if any, to the mortgagee.  \n\nThe mortgagee must credit the refund against any deficiency owed by you and return any amount not credited to you.  \n\nThis mortgagee interest provision shall apply to any trustee or loss payee or other secured party.  \n\nYour Estimated Home Replacement Cost  \n\nAllstate has determined that the estimated cost to replace your home is: \\$320,266.  \n\nWe based your estimated cost on information provided by you and selected data that was available to us, which is described in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page. Please review all the information in this section to ensure the accuracy of the information used to determine the estimated replacement cost of your home.  \n\nThe enclosed Declarations Page shows the limit of liability applicable to Dwelling Protection–Coverage A of your homeowners insurance policy. The estimated replacement cost of your home is the minimum amount for which we will insure your home.  \n\nThe decision regarding the limit applicable to your Dwelling Protection–Coverage A is your decision to make, as long as, at a minimum, your limit equals the estimated replacement cost as determined by Allstate and does not exceed maximum coverage limitations established by Allstate.  \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that your Coverage A limits reflect a replacement cost that is only an estimate based on data that was available to us when we made this estimate (this information is described in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page). The actual amount it will cost to replace your home cannot be known until after a covered total loss has occurred. Please keep in mind that we do not guarantee the adequacy of the estimate to cover any future loss(es).  \n\nHow Is the Replacement Cost Estimated?  \n\nMany factors can affect the cost to replace your home, including its age, size, and type of construction. For example, the replacement cost uses construction data, such as labor and materials, that are available to us when we made this estimate. This estimate is also based on characteristics of the home, which include information that you provided to us. You might have chosen to insure your home for a higher amount than the estimated replacement cost shown above.  \n\nNote to Customers Renewing Their Policy  \n\nThe estimated replacement cost for your home may have changed since the last time we communicated this information to you. This is because, at renewal, Allstate uses the home characteristics that you have provided to us to recalculate and update the estimated replacement cost. Using updated labor and material rates for your zip code, Allstate takes the home characteristics you have provided and determines the updated estimated replacement cost. The information about your  \n\nhome’s characteristics is provided in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page.  \n\nPlease note: Your Dwelling information is used to estimate your home replacement cost. It’s important to review and update this information so we’re using the most accurate details to estimate your home’s replacement value.  \n\nIf the information about your home shown in your Declarations Page requires any change or if you have any questions or concerns about the information contained in this Important Notice, please contact your Allstate representative, or call us at 1-800-ALLSTATE.  \n\nX73182-1  \n\nAddress Confirmation Request  \n\nPlease Confirm Your Current Address  \n\nAs you may know, we base our property insurance rates, in part, on where a customer’s property is located. According to our records, the location of the dwelling your property policy covers is:  \n\nAddress: 410 Presswood Dr   \nCity/Village/Township: Spring   \nState: TX   \nZip: 77386-1207   \nCounty: Montgomery  \n\nWe ask that you please review this information to make sure the address we’ve listed above is accurate. If you see any information that is incorrect, please contact your Allstate representative as soon as possible and provide them with the correct information. Once we receive your updated information, we will send you an Amended Declarations Page and, if necessary, adjust your insurance premium to reflect the updated information.  \n\nIf the information above is correct, you do not need to contact us. Feel free to contact your Allstate representative with any questions you may have about this notice.  \n\nX72770  \n\nInformation Regarding Flood Damage Coverage  \n\nTexas law requires that we provide you with this notice regarding flood damage coverage.  \n\nPlease read this notice carefully. In addition, it is important to read all of your property policy documents to confirm the coverage your policy provides.  \n\nNOTICE  \n\nFlood Insurance: You may also need to consider the purchase of flood insurance. Your insurance policy does not include coverage for damage resulting from a flood even if hurricane winds and rain caused the flood to occur. Without separate flood insurance coverage, you may have uncovered losses caused by a flood. Please discuss the need to purchase separate flood insurance coverage with your insurance agent or insurance company, or visit www.floodsmart.gov.  \n\nIf you have any questions about this notice or your policy coverage, you can contact your Allstate Agent or representative, call 1-800 ALLSTATE® (1-800-255-7828), or visit www.allstate.com. We’re here to help!  \n\nYour policy contains several exclusions, which are listed in the sections titled “Losses We Do Not Cover” throughout the policy. All these exclusions can impact the coverage provided by your policy. Please review your policy, including all the policy exclusions, carefully.  \n\nAmong the other exclusions, your policy does not provide Dwelling Protection, Other Structures Protection, or Personal Property Protection coverage for loss caused by or consisting of any type of vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, toxic gasses, toxic liquids, toxic solids, waste materials, irritants, contaminants, or pollutants.  \n\nintended location is covered. Also, bodily injury resulting from the sudden and accidental discharge, dispersal, release or escape of carbon monoxide from a heating system, an appliance for heating water, or a household appliance located at the residence premises is covered.  \n\nCertain Losses Are Excluded  \n\nYour policy does not cover any liability imposed upon any insured person by any governmental authority for bodily injury or property damage which results in any manner from, or for property damage consisting of or caused by, any type of vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, toxic gasses, toxic liquids, toxic solids, waste materials, irritants, contaminants, or pollutants.  \n\nYour policy also does not provide Liability or Medical coverage for bodily injury or property damage which results in any manner from any type of vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, toxic gasses, toxic liquids, toxic solids, waste materials, irritants, contaminants or pollutants.

They then use this information to set up fake accounts, open loans, rent housing, secure employment or even obtain medical care—all without you even knowing.  \n\nAs this crime grows increasingly common, consumers need options for dealing with the costs and hassles related to identity theft—that’s why we’re offering Identity Theft Expenses Coverage.  \n\nFor Just $\\pmb{\\530}$ per Year, You Can Get Help to Restore Your Good Name  \n\nNow Allstate has a product that can help you if your identity is stolen.

There are many issues you would need help with, including:  \n\n— Understanding your rights as an identity theft victim.   \n— Filling out paperwork, including police reports. Issuing a Fraud Alert to the three major credit bureaus, as well as Social Security Administration, Federal Trade Commission, and U.S. Postal Service. Obtaining copies of your credit bureau reports.   \n— Working with the three major credit bureaus to restore the accuracy of your credit history. Reviewing your credit history to verify if fraud includes items such as public records (liens, judgments, bankruptcies); credit accounts; or errors with addresses/ prior employment. Issuing a fraud alert to affected financial institutions and credit card companies. Tracing Social Security Numbers and notifying and working with the Department of Motor Vehicles, collection agencies for creditors, and law enforcement personnel.  \n\nThis may seem overwhelming, but our Identity Theft Expenses Coverage can help.

In addition, we may refer you to a firm that specializes in addressing the effects of identity theft.\\ In either case, if you have this coverage you’ll have peace of mind knowing you can get help to restore your identity.  \n\nAre You in Good Hands®?  \n\nWith Allstate you’re getting more than great products and service.

Please read the policy endorsements carefully  \n\nX71831-1  \n\nAdditional Protection for Your Most Valuable Possessions  \n\nProperty insurance covers many belongings, but some items may require higher coverage limits than those in a standard property policy.  \n\nScheduled Personal Property (SPP) coverage gives you additional protection against loss or damage to your valuables. It’s protection not typically provided with standard property coverage. SPP benefits typically include:  \n\nNo deductibles to meet — Coverage for lost or damaged items Coverage for valuables kept in a storage location outside your home  \n\nItems That May Need the Extra Protection  \n\nSPP coverage provides protection for an array of valuable personal property. Here are some of the items you can protect by purchasing SPP coverage through Allstate:  \n\nJewelry (including wedding rings and precious or   \nsemi-precious stones)   \nFurs   \nCameras (digital, still, movie, video and related   \nequipment)   \nSilverware and antiques (including furniture)   \nMusical instruments  \n\n— Collections (stamps, coins, music) Fine art works (including paintings, etchings, vases and sculptures) Manuscripts or books Home-office equipment (laptop, computer, audio/visual) Sports equipment (such as golf clubs)  \n\nAffordable Protection for Your Valuables  \n\nThe cost of SPP coverage varies, but the value of your property is the best way to determine how much coverage you need. The rates are generally a small percentage of the total value of the items you’re insuring. This means that your valuables are being protected for only a fraction of the cost.  \n\nRegularly Review Your SPP Coverage  \n\nEven if you currently have SPP coverage, it’s a good idea to review it annually. It’s possible that the value of your property has changed or that you’ve purchased new items that have not been added to your coverage.  \n\nTo learn more about SPP coverage, or if you have any questions about your insurance policy in general, contact your Allstate representative, or visit us at allstate.com.  \n\nX73169  \n\nWhat You Should Know About Flood Insurance  \n\nMost homeowners, renters and commercial insurance policies do not provide coverage for flood damage. In fact, protection against floods is generally available only through a separate policy.  \n\nThat’s why Allstate is a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and offers standard flood insurance policies.\\ A flood insurance policy can help complete the insurance protection for your property and help protect your financial well-being.  \n\nYou May Have More Risk from Flood Than You Think  \n\nApproximately 90 percent of all disasters in the U.S. are flood related. While you may think that it couldn’t happen to you, over 25 percent of all flood losses occur in low- to moderate-risk areas.  \n\nWhat’s more, flood damage is often accompanied by other damage, such as wind and hail (which is typically covered under a property policy). So if you purchase your NFIP coverage through Allstate, you would have the convenience and peace of mind that comes with working with just one claim adjuster and one agent, instead of two or more for a flood claim.  \n\nFlood Coverage Is Affordable  \n\nThe federal government sets the rates for flood insurance, so there’s typically no difference in rates from policy to policy. You can switch to an NFIP flood insurance policy administered by Allstate for the same amount of premium you may be paying elsewhere. If you choose Allstate, you can have the quality service you’ve come to expect from us.  \n\nSubject to availability and qualifications. Other terms, conditions and exclusions may apply.  \n\nFor more information about flood insurance, or if you have any questions about your policy in general, please contact your Allstate representative or visit us at allstate.com.  \n\n\\ Allstate provides the standard flood insurance policy under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The standard flood insurance policy is written by Allstate for the National Flood Insurance Program which is administered by the Federal Insurance Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  \n\nHow We Compensate Our Agencies  \n\nThe company listed below uses local agencies to assist customers with their insurance decision-making process by providing customers with information and high quality service. These agencies provide numerous services to customers on the company’s behalf. Agencies are paid a commission by the company for selling and servicing the company’s insurance policies and may be eligible to receive additional compensation and rewards based on performance.  \n\nAllstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company  \n\nX72006-1  \n\nImportant Information About the Recoupment Charge on Your Declarations Page  \n\nIn 2001 the Texas Legislature created the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program to help finance volunteer fire departments across the state with equipment and training.  \n\nIn order to cover the costs for this program, Texas law permits the Texas Comptroller to assess charges on insurance  \n\ncompanies, like Allstate, to fund the Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Fund. The law also allows an insurance company to then recover these assessments by charging their policyholders.  \n\nAs a result of this program, a nominal recoupment charge has been added to your premium and is listed on the enclosed Declarations Page. Please note that this charge will also appear on your bill, which will be sent to you soon in a separate mailing.  \n\nIf you have questions about any of the information contained in this notice, please contact your Allstate representative.  \n\nX71712  \n\nUse Of Credit Information Disclosure  \n\nInsurer’s name: Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company  \n\nAddress: 2775 Sanders Road Northbrook, IL 60062  \n\nTelephone number: 1-800-ALLSTATE (1-800-255-7828)  \n\nAllstate will obtain and use credit information on you or any other member(s) of your household as a part of the insurance credit scoring process.  \n\nIf you have questions regarding this disclosure, contact the insurer at the above address or phone number. For information or other questions, contact the Texas Department of Insurance at 1-800-578-4677 or P.O Box 149104, MC104-PC, Austin, Texas 78714.  \n\nSection 559.053 of the Texas Insurance Code requires an insurer or its agents to disclose to its customers whether credit information will be obtained on the applicant or insured or on any other member(s) of the applicant’s or insured’s household and used as part of the insurance credit scoring process.  \n\nIf credit information is obtained or used on the applicant or insured, or on any member of the applicant’s or insured’s household, the insurer shall disclose to the applicant the name of each person on whom credit information was obtained or used and how each person’s credit information was used to underwrite or rate the policy. An insurer may provide this information with this disclosure or in a separate notice.  \n\nAdverse effect means an action taken by an insurer in connection with the underwriting of insurance for a consumer that results in the denial of coverage, the cancellation or  \n\nnonrenewal of coverage, or the offer to and acceptance by a consumer of a policy form, premium rate, or deductible other than the policy form, premium rate, or deductible for which the consumer specifically applied.  \n\nCredit information is any credit related information derived from a credit report itself, or provided in an application for personal insurance. The term does not include information that is not credit-related, regardless of whether the information is contained in a credit report or in an application for insurance coverage or is used to compute a credit score.  \n\nCredit score or insurance score is a number or rating derived from a mathematical formula, computer application, model, or other process that is based on credit information and used to predict the future insurance loss exposure of a consumer.  \n\nSUMMARY OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS CONTAINED IN CHAPTER 559  \n\nPROHIBITED USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION.  An insurer may not:  \n\n(1) use a credit score that is computed using factors that constitute unfair discrimination;   \n(2) deny, cancel, or nonrenew a policy of personal insurance solely on the basis of credit information without consideration of any other applicable underwriting factor independent of credit information; or   \n(3) take an action that results in an adverse effect against a consumer because the consumer does not have a credit card account without consideration of any other applicable factor independent of credit information.  \n\nAn insurer may not consider an absence of credit information or an inability to determine credit information for an applicant for insurance coverage or insured as a factor in underwriting or rating an insurance policy unless the insurer:  \n\n(1) has statistical, actuarial, or reasonable underwriting information that: (A) is reasonably related to actual or anticipated loss experience; and (B) shows that the absence of credit information could result in actual or anticipated loss differences;   \n(2) treats the consumer as if the applicant for insurance coverage or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer; or   \n(3) excludes the use of credit information as a factor in underwriting and uses only other underwriting criteria.  \n\nNEGATIVE FACTORS. An insurer may not use any of the following as a negative factor in any credit scoring  \n\nmethodology or in reviewing credit information to underwrite or rate a policy of personal insurance:  \n\n(1) a credit inquiry that is not initiated by the consumer;   \n(2) an inquiry relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer’s credit report; or   \n(3) a collection account with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer’s credit report.  \n\nMultiple lender inquiries made within 30 days of a prior inquiry, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s credit report as from the home mortgage or motor vehicle lending industry, shall be considered by an insurer as only one inquiry.  \n\nEFFECT OF EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS.  An insurer shall, on written request from an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured, provide reasonable exceptions to the insurer’s rates, rating classifications, or underwriting rules for a consumer whose credit information has been directly influenced by a catastrophic illness or injury, by the death of a spouse, child, or parent, by temporary loss of employment, by divorce, or by identity theft. In such a case, the insurer may consider only credit information not affected by the event or shall assign a neutral credit score.  \n\nAn insurer may require reasonable written and independently verifiable documentation of the event and the effect of the event on the person’s credit before granting an exception. An insurer is not required to consider repeated events or events the insurer reconsidered previously as an extraordinary event.  \n\nAn insurer may also consider granting an exception to an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured for an extraordinary event not listed in this section. An insurer is not out of compliance with any law or rule relating to underwriting, rating, or rate filing as a result of granting an exception under this article.  \n\nNOTICE OF ACTION RESULTING IN ADVERSE EFFECT.  If an insurer takes an action resulting in an adverse effect with respect to an applicant for insurance coverage or insured based in whole or in part on information contained in a credit report, the insurer must provide to the applicant or insured within 30 days certain information regarding how an applicant or insured may verify and dispute information contained in a credit report.  \n\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION; ERROR CORRECTION.  If it is determined through the dispute resolution process established under Section 611(a)(5), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1681i), as amended, that the credit information of a current insured was inaccurate or incomplete or could not be verified and the insurer receives notice of that determination from the consumer reporting agency or from the insured, the insurer shall re-underwrite and re-rate the insured not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt of the notice.  \n\nAfter re-underwriting or re-rating the insured, the insurer shall make any adjustments necessary within 30 days, consistent with the insurer’s underwriting and rating guidelines. If an insurer determines that the insured has overpaid premium, the insurer shall credit the amount of overpayment. The insurer shall compute the overpayment back to the shorter of the last 12 months of coverage; or the actual policy period.  \n\nCD-1 v.0710  \n\nDid Extraordinary Circumstances Affect Your Credit Information?  \n\nAllstate understands that people sometimes face difficult circumstances. If extraordinary life events have negatively affected your credit history, you may request that we consider this when we review your credit information, as part of the policy rating process. These extraordinary life circumstances include:  \n\n— Divorce or Dissolution of Marriage   \n— Death of a Spouse, Child, Parent or Member of the Same Household   \n— Involuntary Unemployment   \n— Catastrophic Medical Expense   \n— Medical Crisis   \n— Care of Adult Dependent   \n— Identity Theft Serious or Catastrophic Long-term Injury, Illness or Disability   \n— Care of a Dependent Grandchild Domestic Violence  \n\nYour Next Steps  \n\nIf you believe any of these experiences have negatively affected your credit history, please contact your Allstate representative or call Allstate directly at 1-877-304-2644. If you decide you want us to review your information, please give us a call within 90 days of the date your policy begins (as shown in your Declarations Page).  \n\nWhat You Can Expect  \n\nIf you contact us, we will send you an Extraordinary Circumstances Appeal Form to complete and return to us. We also will ask you to provide any documentation that will help your appeal. Once we receive your Extraordinary Circumstances Appeal Form and supporting documentation, we will evaluate your appeal and determine whether or not you qualify for a lower premium. In any case, you will be notified of the outcome of our review.  \n\nThank You  \n\nAllstate values and appreciates your business. We look forward to helping protect what’s important to you for many years.  \n\nX73326  \n\nYou’re Receiving the Responsible Payment Discount  \n\nAs an added benefit of being an Allstate customer, you’re receiving our Responsible Payment Discount on your House & Home policy.  \n\nHere’s how the Responsible Payment Discount works. From this point on, you will continue to receive this discount:  \n\n— If you pay your premium in full. If you pay your premium through a third party (e.g., escrow). If we do not send you a cancellation notice for nonpayment of premium (the billing notice we send when we don’t receive your payment on time). If we send you a cancellation notice for nonpayment of premium and your policy renews, the discount will be reduced at renewal, which may cause your overall insurance premium to increase. If this discount is reduced because of a cancellation notice, we will add it back to your policy at renewal if no cancellation notices for nonpayment of premium have been sent to you within the most recent twelve-month period ending 45 days prior to your renewal effective date.  \n\nPayment Options to Help You Save Money  \n\nWe want you to continue saving money with the Responsible Payment Discount, so we offer several ways to make paying your bills fast and easy.  \n\nYou can sign up for the Allstate® Easy Pay Plan, which allows us to deduct your insurance premiums each month, or in full, from your checking account. You’ll save on  \n\npostage, have fewer checks to write, and have the monthly installment fee reduced.   \nYou can also pay your premium over the phone with either a check or credit card. Simply call us toll-free at   \n1-800-ALLSTATE. You’ll be asked for your policy number when you pay by phone, so it’s a good idea to have your policy documents in hand before you call.   \nYou can set up an escrow account to ensure your   \npremiums are paid on time. (Please contact your mortgage lender for more information on setting up an escrow   \naccount.)  \n\nYou can choose to pay your premium in full.  \n\nHave Questions? Please Contact Us If you have any questions about the Responsible Payment Discount, or if you’d like more information about the different bill paying options available to you, please contact your Allstate representative, or call us toll-free at 1-800-ALLSTATE.  \n\nX73075  \n\nAdd the Enhanced Package to Your Policy and Save Even More  \n\nConsider adding the Enhanced Package to your House & Home policy for even greater value.  \n\nThe Enhanced Package gives you all of these benefits:  \n\nClaim RateGuard®—Allows you to keep your Claim-Free Discount (if you qualify for the discount) and protects your rate from going up just because you file a claim.   \nClaim-Free Bonus—Gives you up to a $5\\%$ premium credit each year you go without a claim.   \nDeductible Reward—You may qualify for an immediate $\\mathtt{5700}$ off a qualified deductible when you add the Enhanced Package.

If you have any questions regarding the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the deductible options available to you or your insurance coverage in general, please contact your Allstate representative.  \n\nWhen does the “Tropical Cyclone Deductible” apply?  \n\nThe Tropical Cyclone Deductible is a separate deductible that applies in the event of covered loss “caused by tropical cyclone or by any object(s) driven by tropical cyclone.”  \n\nFor the purpose of the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, we've defined “tropical cyclone” as “a hurricane, a tropical storm, or any wind, hail, rain, snow, or sleet accompanying a hurricane or a tropical storm.”  \n\nIf another deductible applicable to the loss exceeds the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the greater deductible will apply. “Please refer to the Tropical Cyclone Deductible Endorsement for other applicable definitions and provisions.”  \n\nWhen does the “Windstorm and Hail Deductible” apply?  \n\nThe Windstorm and Hail Deductible is a separate deductible that applies for sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by windstorm or hail to covered property when the Tropical Cyclone Deductible does not apply. This is the total amount of deductible for any one loss due to windstorm or hail.  \n\nIf another deductible applicable to the loss exceeds the Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the greater deductible will apply. “Please refer to the Windstorm and Hail Deductible Endorsement for other applicable definitions and provisions.”  \n\nWhat are the amounts of the “Tropical Cyclone Deductible” and “Windstorm and Hail Deductible” and how are they calculated?  \n\nYour Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm and Hail Deductible amounts appear on the enclosed Policy Declarations. When the Tropical Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail Deductible applies, we will pay for a covered loss only when the amount of that loss exceeds that deductible amount shown on the Declarations Page (subject to applicable policy terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions). We will then pay only the excess amount.  \n\nThe following example illustrates how the Tropical Cyclone Deductible and the Windstorm and Hail Deductible are calculated when percentage deductibles are applicable. The amounts of your Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm and Hail Deductible would be based upon a percentage of your Dwelling Protection coverage limit. If your Dwelling Protection coverage limit is $^{\\oint100,000}$ and you have a $5\\%$ Tropical Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail Deductible, your Tropical Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail Deductible amount would be $^{85,000(.05\\times\\mathcal{5}100,000)}$ . If the covered loss is not caused by a tropical cyclone or wind or hail, the All Other Peril Deductible listed on your Declarations Page will apply.  \n\nYou may have the option to reduce your policy premium by choosing a higher deductible. Please keep in mind that if you choose a higher deductible, your premium may decrease, however, the amount we pay you for a covered loss will be less when the deductible applies. Your Allstate representative can discuss your options with you.  \n\nIf a percentage deductible applies to your Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm and Hail Deductible, it is calculated as a percentage of your Dwelling Protection coverage limit, your deductible amount will change accordingly if your Dwelling Protection coverage limit changes for any reason, including, for example:  \n\n— you change your Dwelling Protection coverage limit; or due to the application of the policy’s Property Insurance Adjustment provision, if applicable, which may automatically increase your Dwelling Protection coverage limit as described in the policy.  \n\nFurther details regarding these deductibles can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Deductible Endorsement and the Windstorm and Hail Deductible Endorsement. Again, if you have any questions regarding the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the deductible options available to you or your insurance coverage in general, please contact your Allstate representative.  \n\nImportant Information About Your Credit-Based Insurance Score  \n\nPlease take a moment to read the notice immediately following this insert containing important information about our use of consumer reports and your rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. In that notice, we explain why we order credit reports and explain how important it is for you to check the accuracy of that information.  \n\nIn the state where we issued your policy we are required by law to inform you of certain factors in your credit report(s) adversely affecting your credit-based insurance score. The most significant of these factors are:  \n\nThe average number of months that accounts are listed on the credit report: Generally, the longer your average age of accounts, the more favorable your insurance score will be. Those with the most favorable insurance scores often have an average age of accounts of 16 years or longer.  \n\nThe number of months since the most recent delinquent payment: A delinquent payment is one made over 30 days late. Delinquent payments within the past five years may have an adverse effect on an insurance score and the more recent the delinquency, the greater the adverse effect. Please note that over time the impact of this type of delinquency on your insurance score will decrease and even disappear if there are no new delinquencies. Avoiding future delinquencies may benefit your insurance score.  \n\nThe presence of a collection within the past five years: When we refer to a \"collection,\" this could include collections that were previously paid off or collections on closed accounts. We exclude medical collections that are identified as such. Those with the most favorable insurance scores will typically have no collections on their credit report. Avoiding future collections may lead to a more favorable insurance score.  \n\nThe presence of a derogatory item within the past five years:  A derogatory item may include a delinquency, a collection, or a derogatory public record, such as a bankruptcy, judgment, lien, repossession, or foreclosure. Avoiding derogatory items in the future may lead to a more favorable insurance score.  \n\nYou may request a copy of your TransUnion Personal Credit Report by writing to:  \n\nTransUnion National Disclosure Center   \n2 Baldwin Place   \nP.O. Box 1000   \nChester, PA 19022   \n1(888)503-0048   \nwww.transunion.com  \n\nConsumer Report Information and Its Impact on Your Insurance  \n\nMany factors play a role in determining your insurance premium. Among the factors we consider are the following: where you live, the coverages and limits you’ve chosen and discount eligibility. In addition, we use consumer reporting agency information for eligibility and rating purposes. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to inform you when we take adverse action based on a consumer report.  \n\nAs permitted by law, we ordered credit report information about you and your spouse, who are both named insureds on the policy.  \n\nBased in whole or in part on the information provided to us by the credit reporting agency listed below, Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company is unable to offer you a lower rate: based on the credit information available to us.  \n\nYou May Request a Free Credit Report  \n\nUnder Section 612 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have the right to obtain a free copy of your consumer report from the consumer reporting agency listed below if you request it within 60 days of receiving this notice (even if the report did not contain any information regarding credit status). You also have the right, under Section 611 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to dispute with the consumer reporting agency listed below the accuracy or completeness of any information in any report(s) furnished by the agency.  \n\nIf you’d like a free copy of your credit report, be sure to make your request within 60 days of receiving this notice.

Also, any changes to your name or address within the past two years can affect the completeness of your report. If your information has changed, please let your insurance representative know.  \n\nHave Questions? Please Contact Your Allstate Representative  \n\nWe hope you will take advantage of these rights and help us give you the lowest premium we can provide. If you have any questions about the information contained in this notice, or about your insurance in general, please contact your insurance representative.  \n\nThe Connection Between Credit History and Premium  \n\nWe determine premiums using the information you provide on your insurance application, as well as using other factors. Certain credit report information has proved an effective predictor of insurance losses. It also allows us to keep costs competitive by helping make it possible for customers who are less likely to experience losses to pay less for their insurance. Keep in mind we use credit history in addition to, not instead of, our other characteristics. By considering this information, we can match likelihood of loss to premium even more precisely, and we think that’s good for our customers. It allows us to keep insurance costs as competitive as possible for the greatest number of policyholders. You can also learn more about our use of credit information, including ways you may be able to improve your insurance score, by visiting allstate.com.  \n\nIn states which have laws that provide couples entering into civil unions, domestic partnerships, or similar relationships the benefits, protections and responsibilities under law as are granted to spouses in a marriage in this state, the term \"spouse\" in this notice includes civil partners, domestic partners or any similar relationship recognized by the laws of this state.  \n\nPlease keep in mind that the consumer reporting agency(ies) did not make the decision to take this adverse action and will not be able to provide you with any specific reasons regarding why we took this action. Also, any changes to your name or address within the past two years can affect the completeness of your file with the consumer reporting agency(ies). If your information has changed, please let your insurance representative know.  \n\nUnder Section 612 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have the right to obtain a free copy of your report(s) provided to us by the consumer reporting agency listed below if you request it within 60 days of receiving this notice. You also have the right, under Section 611 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to dispute with the consumer reporting agency the accuracy or completeness of any information in the consumer report(s) furnished by the agency.  \n\nTo request your report, you may contact the appropriate consumer reporting agency at:  \n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions   \nPO Box 105108   \nAtlanta, GA 30348-5108   \nPhone: (800) 456-6004 IVR, 1-888-497-0011 for live agent   \nconsumer.risk.lexisnexis.com  \n\nIf you have any questions regarding this notice or your policy in general, please contact your insurance representative.  \n\nXF1  \n\nConsumer Report Information and Its Impact on Your Insurance  \n\nIn an effort to keep insurance costs as competitive as possible for the greatest number of policyholders, we may consider certain prior insurance information, prior insurance loss information, driving information and motor vehicle reports (MVR), when determining our customers’ eligibility, premiums and payment options. We’re writing now to let you know we recently ordered consumer report information about you and, if applicable, another insured person named on your policy, and we are providing you with additional details about this process.  \n\nBased in whole or in part on the information provided to us by Current Carrier Database (CCDB), Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company could not offer you a lower rate.  \n\nCONSUMER BILL OF RIGHTS Homeowners, Dwelling, and Renters Insurance  \n\nWhat is the Bill of Rights?  \n\nIt is a basic outline of important rights you have under Texas law.
