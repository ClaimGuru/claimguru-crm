# Help Protect Your Most Personal Asset—Your Identity  

Thank you for choosing Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company—we’re delighted to have you with us!  

We're pleased to once again offer you the chance to continue your House & Home policy for another twelve months. With your policy about to renew, now is the perfect time for you to determine whether the coverage you have is suited to the risks you face today.  

# Have You Considered Our Identity Theft Expenses Coverage?  

That’s why we'd like you to know about our affordable Identity Theft Expenses Coverage option. It’s designed to help reimburse you for covered expenses and the hassles of restoring your good name if your identity is stolen with this increasingly common type of theft.  

Identity theft is a relatively new but growing crime that can lead to refused loans, lost job opportunities, and even arrest for crimes never committed. Now you can purchase our optional coverage to help restore your identity if you become a victim of this crime.  

# $\pmb{\530}$ a Year—A Small Price Now Can Help with Higher Costs Later  

For just $\mathtt{530}$ a year and no deductible, we’ll reimburse you for covered expenses you incur to help restore your identity, up to a coverage limit of $\mathtt{\oint}25,000$ . While some products out there today may provide less reimbursement and leave you to deal with creditors, banks, and government agencies on your own, Allstate goes a step further. We may also refer you to an identity theft restoration services company that can help you sort out the effects of an identity theft\* with creditors and government agencies.  

# Do You Have the Protection You Need?  

As you review your Declarations Page, consider whether you’d like to update your policy to include Identity Theft Expenses Coverage. To add this coverage, or to make any changes to your policy, feel free to call us at (800) 474-1377.  

For more detailed information about Identity Theft Expenses Coverage, please refer to the enclosed “Identity Theft Expenses Coverage—Coverage for Identity Theft Victims” information at the back of this mailing.

# Your Estimated Home Replacement Cost  

Allstate has determined that the estimated cost to replace your home is: \$236,300.  

We based your estimated cost on information provided by you and selected data that was available to us, which is described in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page. Please review all the information in this section to ensure the accuracy of the information used to determine the estimated replacement cost of your home.  

The enclosed Declarations Page shows the limit of liability applicable to Dwelling Protection–Coverage A of your homeowners insurance policy. The estimated replacement cost of your home is the minimum amount for which we will insure your home.  

The decision regarding the limit applicable to your Dwelling Protection–Coverage A is your decision to make, as long as, at a minimum, your limit equals the estimated replacement cost as determined by Allstate and does not exceed maximum coverage limitations established by Allstate.  

It is important to keep in mind that your Coverage A limits reflect a replacement cost that is only an estimate based on data that was available to us when we made this estimate (this information is described in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page). The actual amount it will cost to replace your home cannot be known until after a covered total loss has occurred. Please keep in mind that we do not guarantee the adequacy of the estimate to cover any future loss(es).  

# How Is the Replacement Cost Estimated?  

Many factors can affect the cost to replace your home, including its age, size, and type of construction. For example, the replacement cost uses construction data, such as labor and materials, that are available to us when we made this estimate. This estimate is also based on characteristics of the home, which include information that you provided to us. You might have chosen to insure your home for a higher amount than the estimated replacement cost shown above.  

# Note to Customers Renewing Their Policy  

The estimated replacement cost for your home may have changed since the last time we communicated this information to you. This is because, at renewal, Allstate uses the home characteristics that you have provided to us to recalculate and update the estimated replacement cost. Using updated labor and material rates for your zip code, Allstate takes the home characteristics you have provided and determines the updated estimated replacement cost. The information about your  

home’s characteristics is provided in the “Insured property details” section of your Declarations Page.  

# Please note: Your Dwelling information is used to estimate your home replacement cost. It’s important to review and update this information so we’re using the most accurate details to estimate your home’s replacement value.  

If the information about your home shown in your Declarations Page requires any change or if you have any questions or concerns about the information contained in this Important Notice, please contact your Allstate representative, or call us at 1-800-ALLSTATE.  

# Additional Information About Dwelling Protection Limits  

Your policy includes a feature called "Property Insurance Adjustment" (PIA).  PIA reflects changes in construction costs in your area that may have occurred during the policy period.  This information is useful in estimating the amount of insurance coverage needed to cover the cost of rebuilding your home in the event of a covered total loss.  

We would like you to know that your policy's PIA recently indicated that certain construction costs in your market have declined.  Based on this information, you may decide to lower your Dwelling Protection limits.  If you choose to lower your Dwelling Protection-Coverage A limits, your premium will decrease accordingly.  Please note that decreasing your Dwelling Protection limits may result in decreases in other coverages that are tied to your Coverage A limits and could lower your premium.  

It is important for you to understand that PIA estimates are only estimates and lowering your Dwelling Protection limits may leave you with insufficient coverage in the event of a loss. For example, if you have done any remodeling to your home which has not been updated in our records, your home's replacement cost may be higher than our current records indicate.  In that case, you may want to maintain or even increase your limits.  Conversely, there is a possibility that your current limits may provide coverage in excess of the actual replacement cost of your home not only based on the PIA estimate, but on other considerations.  For example, if you originally decided to insure your home at an amount that exceeded the estimated replacement cost, you may want to call your Allstate representative to discuss the current value of your home and the possibility of lowering your limits.  

If you have any questions about PIA, or your policy in general, please contact your Allstate representative.

# Information Regarding Flood Damage Coverage  

Texas law requires that we provide you with this notice regarding flood damage coverage.  

Please read this notice carefully. In addition, it is important to read all of your property policy documents to confirm the coverage your policy provides.  

# NOTICE  

Flood Insurance: You may also need to consider the purchase of flood insurance. Your insurance policy does not include coverage for damage resulting from a flood even if hurricane winds and rain caused the flood to occur. Without separate flood insurance coverage, you may have uncovered losses caused by a flood. Please discuss the need to purchase separate flood insurance coverage with your insurance agent or insurance company, or visit www.floodsmart.gov.  

If you have any questions about this notice or your policy coverage, you can contact your Allstate Agent or representative, call 1-800 ALLSTATE® (1-800-255-7828), or visit www.allstate.com. We’re here to help!

# Please Check Your Policy Coverage Limits  

When we first issued your Allstate policy, you selected specific coverages and coverage limits to protect your property. However, your property’s value may have changed since that time. We’d like to remind you that it is your responsibility to carefully review your coverages and coverage limits at each policy renewal and make sure they provide you with adequate coverage.  

Please take a few minutes to review your policy. If you have any questions about your insurance coverage, or if you wish to change your policy limits, please contact your Allstate representative.

# Identity Theft Expenses Coverage— Coverage for Identity Theft Victims  

While modern technology has made our lives easier, it has also made it easier for thieves to commit identity theft.  

Thieves begin by gaining access to personal information such as your Social Security Number, date of birth and driver’s license number. They then use this information to set up fake accounts, open loans, rent housing, secure employment or even obtain medical care—all without you even knowing.  

As this crime grows increasingly common, consumers need options for dealing with the costs and hassles related to identity theft—that’s why we’re offering Identity Theft Expenses Coverage.  

# For Just $\pmb{\530}$ per Year, You Can Get Help to Restore Your Good Name  

Now Allstate has a product that can help you if your identity is stolen. You can add this optional coverage to your property policy for just a few dollars a month—a small price to pay for peace of mind—especially when you consider that while other insurance companies typically require a deductible for similar protection, with Allstate there is no deductible.  

# Allstate Takes Identity Theft Expenses Coverage a Step Further  

If you purchase this coverage, we’ll reimburse you for covered expenses you incur to restore your identity up to a $\mathfrak{S}25$ ,000 coverage limit. That’s more than most companies offer for this type of coverage. This coverage includes reimbursement for:  

Attorneys fees (subject to applicable coverage limits)—in case you need to hire an attorney to defend you if lawsuits are brought against you by merchants or collection agencies, if you need help to remove criminal or civil judgments wrongly entered against you, or to challenge information contained in your credit report. Lost wage recovery (up to $\mathtt{5250}_{\ }$ /day with a $\mathbb{S}5,000$ cap)—this will help cover wages or salary you may lose if you need to take time off work to complete affidavits or meet with law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, credit grantors, credit reporting agencies or attorneys.  

Loan reapplication fees—this covers your expenses if you need to reapply for loans denied you solely because the lender received incorrect information due to identity theft. Other expenses—covers other expenses involved in restoring your identity, such as mailing costs, notary expenses and long-distance phone calls.  

# You Can Get Help If You Become a Victim  

If you become a victim of identity theft, you probably won’t know all that is involved in restoring your name. There are many issues you would need help with, including:  

— Understanding your rights as an identity theft victim.   
— Filling out paperwork, including police reports. Issuing a Fraud Alert to the three major credit bureaus, as well as Social Security Administration, Federal Trade Commission, and U.S. Postal Service. Obtaining copies of your credit bureau reports.   
— Working with the three major credit bureaus to restore the accuracy of your credit history. Reviewing your credit history to verify if fraud includes items such as public records (liens, judgments, bankruptcies); credit accounts; or errors with addresses/ prior employment. Issuing a fraud alert to affected financial institutions and credit card companies. Tracing Social Security Numbers and notifying and working with the Department of Motor Vehicles, collection agencies for creditors, and law enforcement personnel.  

This may seem overwhelming, but our Identity Theft Expenses Coverage can help. With it, if you decide to hire a firm to help you address identity theft issues such as these, you will have up to $\mathtt{52}\mathrm{,000}$ available to pay for their services. In addition, we may refer you to a firm that specializes in addressing the effects of identity theft.\* In either case, if you have this coverage you’ll have peace of mind knowing you can get help to restore your identity.  

# Are You in Good Hands®?  

With Allstate you’re getting more than great products and service. You get a team of people who know insurance and give you the freedom to manage your insurance your way. To sign up for Identity Theft Expenses Coverage, or for more information, just call your Allstate representative or log on to allstate.com.  

# Additional Protection for Your Most Valuable Possessions  

Property insurance covers many belongings, but some items may require higher coverage limits than those in a standard property policy.  

Scheduled Personal Property (SPP) coverage gives you additional protection against loss or damage to your valuables. It’s protection not typically provided with standard property coverage. SPP benefits typically include:  

No deductibles to meet — Coverage for lost or damaged items Coverage for valuables kept in a storage location outside your home  

# Items That May Need the Extra Protection  

SPP coverage provides protection for an array of valuable personal property. Here are some of the items you can protect by purchasing SPP coverage through Allstate:  

Jewelry (including wedding rings and precious or semi-precious stones) Furs Cameras (digital, still, movie, video and related equipment) Silverware and antiques (including furniture) Musical instruments   
— Collections (stamps, coins, music) Fine art works (including paintings, etchings, vases and sculptures) Manuscripts or books   
— Home-office equipment (laptop, computer, audio/visual) Sports equipment (such as golf clubs)  

# Affordable Protection for Your Valuables  

The cost of SPP coverage varies, but the value of your property is the best way to determine how much coverage you need. The rates are generally a small percentage of the total value of the items you’re insuring. This means that your valuables are being protected for only a fraction of the cost.  

# Regularly Review Your SPP Coverage  

Even if you currently have SPP coverage, it’s a good idea to review it annually. It’s possible that the value of your property has changed or that you’ve purchased new items that have not been added to your coverage.  

To learn more about SPP coverage, or if you have any questions about your insurance policy in general, contact your Allstate representative, or visit us at allstate.com.  

# X73169  

# What You Should Know About Flood Insurance  

Most homeowners, renters and commercial insurance policies do not provide coverage for flood damage. In fact, protection against floods is generally available only through a separate policy.  

That’s why Allstate is a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and offers standard flood insurance policies.\* A flood insurance policy can help complete the insurance protection for your property and help protect your financial well-being.  

# You May Have More Risk from Flood Than You Think  

Approximately 90 percent of all disasters in the U.S. are flood related. While you may think that it couldn’t happen to you, over 25 percent of all flood losses occur in low- to moderate-risk areas.  

What’s more, flood damage is often accompanied by other damage, such as wind and hail (which is typically covered under a property policy). So if you purchase your NFIP coverage through Allstate, you would have the convenience and peace of mind that comes with working with just one claim adjuster and one agent, instead of two or more for a flood claim.  

# Flood Coverage Is Affordable  

The federal government sets the rates for flood insurance, so there’s typically no difference in rates from policy to policy. You can switch to an NFIP flood insurance policy administered by Allstate for the same amount of premium you may be paying elsewhere. If you choose Allstate, you can have the quality service you’ve come to expect from us.  

For more information about flood insurance, or if you have any questions about your policy in general, please contact your Allstate representative or visit us at allstate.com.
