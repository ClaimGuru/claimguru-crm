Losses are always difficult, but please be assured that we will work to resolve your claim quickly and fairly.  \n\nWe wanted to let you know that we will need your help to accurately estimate your damages which includes your input on the age and condition of the items before they were damaged. The options for condition are “new”, “above average”, “average”, and “below average”. Information about age and condition is used, in part, to determine the amount of any depreciation that may be applicable. “Depreciation” refers to a decrease in an item’s value due to age and condition and other factors. We look forward to discussing these details with you as well as whether your policy provides the replacement cost coverage option.  \n\nWe have a dedicated team of claim professionals that can assist you during the claim process. Just so you are aware, one or more Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company representatives may contact you about different aspects of your claim.  \n\nWe're here to help. If you need additional information, please visit MyClaim.com or contact us.  \n\nSincerely,  \n\nYour Claim Team  \n\nYour Claim Team   \n800-547-8676   \nAllstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company", "files_in_pdf": []}
