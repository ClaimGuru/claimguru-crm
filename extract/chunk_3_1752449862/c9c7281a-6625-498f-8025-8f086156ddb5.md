there has been compliance with all the terms   
of this policy. The action must be brought   
before the earlier of the following:

a. We  will  pay  for  any  covered  loss  of  or damage  to  buildings  or  structures  to  the mortgagee  shown  in  the  Declarations  as interests appear.   
b. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building structure.   
c. If we deny your claim because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this policy, the mortgagee has the right  to  receive  loss  payment  if  the mortgagee: (1) At our request, pays any premium due under this policy, if you have failed to do so; (2) Submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within 91 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so; and (3) Has  notified  us  of  any  changes  in ownership,  occupancy  or  substantial changes in risk known to the mortgagee. All the terms of this policy will then apply directly to the mortgagee. Failure of the mortgagee to comply with c. (1), (2) or (3) will void this policy as to the interest of the mortgagee.   
d. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this policy: (1) The  mortgagee’s  rights  under  the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay. (2) The mortgagee’s right to recover the full amount of the mortgagee’s claim will not be impaired.

In this event, your mortgage and note will be transferred to us and you will pay your remaining mortgage debt to us.   
e. If this policy is cancelled, we will give the mortgagee  specifically  named  in  the Declarations written notice of cancellation. If we  cancel  the  policy,  we  will  give  the mortgagee the same number of days’ notice of cancellation we give to you. If you cancel the policy, we will give the mortgagee  notice  of  cancellation  to  be effective on the date stated in the notice. The date of cancellation cannot be before the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ day after the date we mail the notice. We will not give notice of cancellation to any successor  or  assignee  of  the  mortgagee named in the policy.   
f. If the property described under PROPERTY COVERAGE  SECTION,  PROPERTY COVERAGE A – DWELLING or PROPERTY COVERAGE B – OTHER STRUCTURES is foreclosed upon under the deed of trust, the mortgagee  may  cancel  this  policy  of insurance  and  will  be  entitled  to  any unearned premium form this policy. The mortgagee must credit any unearned premium against any deficiency owed by the borrower and return any unearned premium not  so  credited  to  the  borrower.  The unearned premium will be figured using the customary pro rata procedures.   
g. If  we  elect  not  to  renew  this  policy,  the mortgagee  specifically  named  in  the Declarations will be given 60 days’ written notice of the nonrenewal.

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT FLOOD DAMAGE  

Flood Insurance: You may also need to consider the purchase of flood insurance. Your insurance policy does not include coverage for damage resulting from a flood even if hurricane winds and rain caused the flood to occur. Without separate flood insurance coverage, you may have uncovered losses caused by a flood. Please discuss the need to purchase separate flood  insurance  coverage  with  your  insurance  agent  or  insurance  company,  or  visit www.floodsmart.gov.  

# Deductibles: Things You Should Know  

What is a deductible? The amount of a covered claim that is your responsibility.  

# How is a deductible applied to a covered claim?  

If you have a loss or damage, the amount that exceeds the applicable deductible will be paid, up to the coverage limit that applies. If the amount of your loss or damage is less than any applicable deductible no payment will be made.  

# Can my policy have more than one deductible that applies to a covered claim?  

Yes, your policy may have different deductibles that apply to different kinds of losses. For most types of losses the Property Coverage Deductible, also called the All Other Perils Deductible, will apply when you  have a loss or damage. Your policy may also include other deductibles that will apply if you have a loss or damage from certain types of loss or from specific perils such as earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorm or hail.  

# Your policy deductibles are:  

Property Coverage Deductible (All Other Perils) \$4,710   
Windstorm or Hail Deductible $2\%$ Coverage A Dwelling Limit \$9,420  

If more than one deductible applies, you will only be responsible for the largest deductible amount.  

# Examples of how deductibles work (for illustrative purposes only)  

# Example\*  

Your Coverage A - Dwelling limit is $\Phi100{,}000$   
Your All Other Peril Deductible is $\mathbb{S}1\,,000$   
Your specific peril deductible (i.e. Hurricane Deductible) is $2\%$ of your Coverage A - Dwelling limit   
( $.02\times\dot{9}100,\!00\dot{0}=\Phi2,\!000)$

\* Your policy’s coverage limits and the dollar amount of your deductible(s) may be higher or lower than the amounts shown in these examples. Please refer to your Policy Declarations for your policy’s actual deductible(s) amounts.  

# Specific Peril Deductibles: Additional Important Information  

Specific peril deductibles may be a set dollar amount or may be a percentage of a policy coverage limit. A percentage deductible is determined by multiplying a policy coverage limit such as Coverage A - Dwelling by the percentage amount shown in your Policy Declarations.  

# Windstorm or Hail Deductible  

Your policy insures against the peril of windstorm or hail. Your Windstorm or Hail Deductible will apply to the total of the loss payable under the Property Coverage Section of your policy. This deductible will replace any other deductible when covered loss or damage is caused directly or indirectly by windstorm or hail.  

# What is my Windstorm or Hail Deductible?  

Your Windstorm or Hail Deductible is $z\%$ of the Coverage A - Dwelling limit which is $\mathbb{S}9{,}420$ . The dollar amount of the Windstorm or Hail Deductible is determined by multiplying the Coverage A - Dwelling limit shown in your Policy Declarations by the Windstorm or Hail Deductible percentage amount shown in your Policy Declarations.  

See your Policy Declarations and Windstorm or Hail Deductible endorsement for further details. If your coverage limit(s) changes, your Windstorm or Hail Deductible may also change.  

# Please read your Policy carefully. If you have any questions, please contact your agent or a Travelers insurance representative.  

# USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION DISCLOSURE  

![](images/i9a44y.jpg)  

Section 559.053, of the Texas Insurance Code requires an insurer or its agents to disclose to its customers whether credit information will be obtained on the applicant or insured or on any other resident relatives of the applicant’s or insured’s household and used as part of the insurance credit scoring process.  

If credit information is obtained or used on the applicant or insured, or on any resident relative of the applicant’s or insured’s household, the insurer shall disclose to the applicant the name of each person on whom credit information was obtained or used and how each person’s credit information was used to underwrite or rate the policy. An insurer may provide this information with this disclosure or in a separate notice.  

Adverse effect means an action taken by an insurer in connection with the underwriting of insurance for a consumer that results in the denial of coverage, the cancellation or nonrenewal of coverage, or the offer to and acceptance by a consumer of a policy form, premium rate, or deductible other than the policy form, premium rate, or deductible for which the consumer specifically applied.  

Credit information is any credit related information derived from a credit report itself, or provided in an application for personal insurance. The term does not include information that is not credit-related, regardless of whether the information is contained in a credit report or in an application for insurance coverage or is used to compute a credit score.  

Credit score or insurance score is a number or rating derived from a mathematical formula, computer application, model, or other process that is based on credit information and used to predict the future insurance loss exposure of a consumer.  

# PROHIBITED USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION.  

An insurer may not:  

1. use a credit score that is computed using factors that constitute unfair discrimination;  

2. deny, cancel, or nonrenew a policy of personal insurance solely on the basis of credit information without consideration of any other applicable underwriting factor independent of credit information; or  

3. take an action that results in an adverse effect against a consumer because the consumer does not have a credit card account without consideration of any other applicable factor independent of credit information.  

An insurer may not consider an absence of credit information or an inability to determine credit information for an applicant for insurance coverage or insured as a factor in underwriting or rating an insurance policy unless the insurer:  

1. has statistical, actuarial, or reasonable underwriting information that: (A) is reasonably related to actual or anticipated loss experience; and (B) shows that the absence of credit information could result in actual or anticipated loss differences;   
2. treats the consumer as if the applicant for insurance coverage or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer; or   
3. excludes the use of credit information as a factor in underwriting and uses only other underwriting criteria.  

# NEGATIVE FACTORS.  

An insurer may not use any of the following as a negative factor in any credit scoring methodology or in reviewing credit information to underwrite or rate a policy of personal insurance:  

1. a credit inquiry that is not initiated by the consumer;   
2. an inquiry relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer’s credit report; or   
3. a collection account with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer’s credit report.  

Multiple lender inquiries made within 30 days of a prior inquiry, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s credit report as from the home mortgage or motor vehicle lending industry, shall be considered by an insurer as only one inquiry.  

# EFFECT OF EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS.  

An insurer shall, on written request from an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured, provide reasonable exceptions to the insurer’s rates, rating classifications, or underwriting rules for a consumer whose credit information has been directly influenced by a catastrophic illness or injury, by the death of a spouse, child, or parent, by temporary loss of employment, by divorce, or by identity theft. In such a case, the insurer may consider only credit information not affected by the event or shall assign a neutral credit score.  

An insurer may require reasonable written and independently verifiable documentation of the event and the effect of the event on the person’s credit before granting an exception. An insurer is not required to consider repeated events or events the insurer reconsidered previously as an extraordinary event.  

An insurer may also consider granting an exception to an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured for an extraordinary event not listed in this section. An insurer is not out of compliance with any law or rule relating to underwriting, rating, or rate filing as a result of granting an exception under this article.  

# NOTICE OF ACTION RESULTING IN ADVERSE EFFECT.  

If an insurer takes an action resulting in an adverse effect with respect to an applicant for insurance coverage or insured based in whole or in part on information contained in a credit report, the insurer must provide to the applicant or insured within 30 days certain information regarding how an applicant or insured may verify and dispute information contained in a credit report.  

# DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ERROR CORRECTION.  

If it is determined through the dispute resolution process established under Section 611(a)(5), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1681i), as amended, that the credit information of a current insured was inaccurate or incomplete or could not be verified and the insurer receives notice of that determination from the consumer reporting agency or from the insured, the insurer shall re-underwrite and re-rate the insured not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt of the notice.  

After re-underwriting or re-rating the insured, the insurer shall make any adjustments necessary within 30 days, consistent with the insurer’s underwriting and rating guidelines. If an insurer determines that the insured has overpaid premium, the insurer shall credit the amount of overpayment. The insurer shall compute the overpayment back to the shorter of the last 12 months of coverage; or the actual policy period.  

# CONSUMER BILL OF RIGHTS Homeowners, Dwelling, and Renters Insurance

# Where to Get Information  

1. Your insurance company. When you get a copy of your policy you will also get an “Important Notice” from the company. The notice explains how to contact your company and how to file a complaint. You may request a complete copy of your policy from your company at any time.   
2. Your declarations page. The declarations page, also called the “dec page,” shows: (a) the name and address of your insurance company, (b) the location of the insured property, (c) the dates your policy is in effect, and (d) the amounts and types of coverage. Your company must list the exact dollar amount of each deductible in your policy. The declarations page, or a separate page, must also list any part of your policy that changes any deductible amount.   
3. The Texas Department of Insurance (TDI). You have the right to call TDI for free at 1-800-252-3439 for information and help with a complaint against an insurer. You can also find information on the TDI website at www.tdi.texas.gov.   
4. Resources for shopping for insurance. The Office of Public Insurance Counsel (OPIC) and TDI developed www.HelpInsure.com to help you compare rates and coverages for different insurance companies. OPIC also has an online tool to help you compare policies. You can find this policy comparison tool at www.opic.texas.gov.  

# What You Should Know When You File a Claim  

5. Deadlines for processing claims and payments. You should file your claim with your insurance company as soon as possible. When you file a claim on your own policy, the insurance company must meet these deadlines:  

Within 15 days after you file a claim: The company must let you know they received your claim. The company must also start their investigation and ask you for any other information they need. Within 15 business days after they get all the information they need: The company must approve or deny your claim in writing. They can extend this deadline up to 45 days from the date they: (a) let you know they need more time and (b) tell you why.   
Within 5 business days after they let you know your claim is approved: The company must pay the claim.  

Note: TDI can extend these deadlines by 15 more days if there is a weather-related catastrophe.  

If your company fails to meet these deadlines, you may be able to collect the claim amount, interest, and attorney’s fees.  

6. Written explanation of claim denial. Your insurance company must tell you in writing why your claim or part of your claim was denied.  

7. Reasonable investigation. Your insurance company cannot refuse to pay your claim without a reasonable investigation of the claim. You should keep records of all claim communications (including notes from phone calls) and other claim documentation (including damage estimates and receipts).  

8. Information not required for processing your claim. Your insurance company can only ask for information reasonably needed for their claim investigation. However, they cannot ask for your federal income tax returns unless: (a) they get a court order or (b) your claim involves a fire loss, loss of profits, or lost income.  

9. Release of claim payments from lenders. Often an insurance company will make a claim payment to you and your lender. If your lender gets the payment:  

No later than 10 days after receiving it they must: (a) notify you and (b) tell you what you must do so the money can be released.  

No later than 10 days after you ask for the money, they must: (a) send the money to you, or (b) tell you how to get the money released.  

If your lender does not: (a) provide the notices mentioned above or (b) pay the money after all the requirements have been met, the lender must pay you interest on the money.  

10. Notice of liability claim settlement. Liability means you are responsible for other people’s injuries or damage to their property. Your insurance company must let you know in writing:  

• About the first offer to settle a claim against you within 10 days after the offer is made.   
• About any claim settled against you within 30 days after the date of the settlement.  

# Who to Contact for Claim Disagreements  

11. Claim disagreements. You can dispute the amount of your claim payment or what is covered under your policy. You can:  

• Contact your insurance company. Contact an attorney to advise you of your rights under the law. The State Bar of Texas can help you find an attorney. Pay a licensed public adjuster to review the damage and handle the claim. File a complaint with TDI.  

# What You Should Know about Renewal, Cancellation and Nonrenewal  

Renewal means that your insurance company is extending your policy for another term. Cancellation means that, before the end of the policy period, the insurance company:  

• Terminates the policy;   
• Gives you less coverage or limits your coverage; or Refuses to give additional coverage that you are entitled to under the policy.  

“Refusal to renew” and “nonrenewal” are terms that mean your coverage ends at the end of the policy period. The policy period is shown on the declarations page of your policy.  

12. Notice of premium increase. If your insurance company plans to increase your premium by 10 percent or more on renewal, your company must send you notice of the rate increase at least 30 days before your renewal date.

• You don’t pay your premium when it is due;   
• You file a fraudulent claim; There is an increase in the risk covered by the policy that is: (a) within your control and (b) would make your premium go up; or TDI decides that keeping the policy violates the law.  

If your policy has been in effect for less than 60 days, your company can only cancel your policy if:  

• One of the reasons listed above applies; They reject a required inspection report within 10 days after getting the report. The report must be done by a licensed or authorized inspector and cannot be more than 90 days old; or  

They find something that creates an increase in risk that you did not include in your application and is not related to a prior claim.  

14. Insurance company cancellation of other residential property policies. After your policy has been in effect for 90 days, your company can only cancel your policy if:  

• You don’t pay your premium when it is due;   
• You file a fraudulent claim; There is an increase in the risk covered by the policy that is: (a) within your control and (b) would make your premium go up; or TDI decides that keeping the policy violates the law.  

15. Notice of cancellation. If your insurance company cancels your policy, they must let you know by mail at least 10 days before the effective date of the cancellation. Check your policy because your company may give you more than 10 days' notice.  

16. Your right to cancel. You can cancel your policy at any time and get a refund of the unused premium.  

17. Refund of premium. If you or your insurance company cancel your policy, the company must refund any unused premium within 15 business days from:  

the date the company receives notice of the cancellation or the date of cancellation, whichever is later.  

You must let your company know you want the refund sent to you. If not, they may refund the remaining premium by giving you a premium credit on the same policy.  

18. Limits on using claims history for nonrenewal. Your insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on claims for damage from natural causes, including weather-related damage; or claims that are filed but not paid or payable under the policy.  

Appliance-related water damage claims. Your insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on an appliance-related water damage claim if:  

The damage has been properly repaired or remediated; and The repair or remediation was inspected and certified.  

However, your insurance company may refuse to renew your policy based on appliance-related water damage claims if:  

Three or more claims were filed and paid (including a claim filed by a prior owner on your property); or You: (a) file 2 claims within a three-year period; and (b) after the second claim, your company gives you written notice that filing a third appliance-related claim could result in your policy not being renewed; and • You file a third claim.  

Claims other than appliance-related water damage claims. Your insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on other claims unless:  

• You: (a) file 2 claims within a three-year period; and (b) after the second claim, your company gives you written notice that filing a third claim could result in your policy not being renewed; and • You file a third claim.  

19. Limits on using claims history to increase premium. Your insurance company cannot increase your premium based on claims for damage from natural causes, including weather-related damage; or claims that are filed but not paid or payable under your policy.  

Appliance-related water damage claims. Your company cannot increase your premium based on a prior appliance-related water damage claim if:  

• The damage has been properly repaired or remediated; and The repair or remediation was inspected and certified.

your premium based on other claims unless: • You file 2 or more claims within a three-year period.  

20. Right to ask questions. You can ask your insurance company a question about your policy. They cannot use your questions to deny, nonrenew, or cancel your coverage. Your questions also cannot be used to determine your premium.  

For example, you may ask:  

• General questions about your policy; Questions about the company’s claims filing process; and Questions about whether the policy will cover a loss, unless the question is about damage: (a) that occurred and (b) that results in an investigation or claim.  

21. Limit on using credit information to nonrenew your policy. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy solely because of your credit.  

22. Protections from discrimination. An insurance company cannot refuse to insure you; limit the coverage you buy; refuse to renew your policy; or charge you a different rate based on your race, color, creed, country of origin, or religion.  

23. Protection for low-value property. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy because the property value is low.  

24. Protection for older houses. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on the age of your property. However, they can refuse to renew your policy based on the condition of your property, including your plumbing, heating, air conditioning, wiring, or roof.  

25. Notice of nonrenewal. Your insurance company must send you a notice that they are not renewing your policy. They must let you know at least 30 days before your policy expires, or you can require them to renew your policy.  

26. Notice of a “material change” to your policy. If your insurance company does not want to cancel or nonrenew your policy, but wants to make certain material changes, then they must explain the changes in writing at least 30 days before the renewal date. Material changes include:  

Giving you less coverage; • Changing a condition of coverage; or Changing what you are required to do.  

Instead of a notice of “material change” a company may choose to not renew your existing policy. If so, the company has to send a nonrenewal letter, but may still offer you a different policy.  

Note: A company cannot reduce coverage during the policy period unless you ask for the change. If you ask for the change, the company does not have to send you a notice.  

27. Written explanation of cancellation or nonrenewal. You can ask your insurance company to tell you in writing the reasons for their decision to cancel or not renew your policy. The company must explain in detail why they cancelled or nonrenewed your policy.
