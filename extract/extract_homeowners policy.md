Subject to the terms of this policy, the Policy Declarations shows the location of the residence premises, applicable coverages, limits of liability and premiums. The policy applies only to losses or occurrences that take place during the policy period. The Policy Period is shown on the Policy Declarations. This policy is not complete without the Policy Declarations. This policy imposes joint obligations on the Named Insured(s) listed on the Policy Declarations and on that person's resident spouse. These persons are defined as you or your. This means that the responsibilities, acts and omissions of a person defined as you or your will be binding upon any other person defined as you or your. Conformity To State Statutes When the policy provisions conflict with the statutes of the state in which the residence premises is located, the provisions are amended to conform to such statutes. Coverage Changes When we broaden coverage during the policy period without charge, you have the new features if you have the coverage to which they apply. Otherwise, the policy can be changed only by endorsement. The coverage provided and the premium for the policy are based on information you have given us. You agree to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete. You agree that if this information changes, or if this information is incorrect or incomplete, we may adjust your coverage and premium accordingly during the policy period. Any calculation of your premium or changes in your coverage will be made using the rules, rates and forms on file, if required, for our use in your state. The rates in effect at the beginning of your current policy period will be used to calculate any change in your premium. Policy Transfer You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. Continued Coverage After Your Death If you die, coverage will continue until the end of the current policy period for: 1. your legal representative while acting as such, but only with respect to the residence premises and property covered under this policy on the date of your death. 2. an insured person, and any person having proper temporary custody of your property until a legal representative is appointed and qualified. Dividend Provision To the extent and upon the conditions fixed and determined from time to time by our Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of the Texas Insurance Code of 1951, as amended, you shall be entitled to participate in a distribution of our surplus. Cancellation 1. You may cancel this policy at any time by notifying us of the date cancellation is to take effect. We will send you any refund due when the policy is returned to us. 2.

An inspection report is deemed accepted, unless we reject it before the 11th day after the date the inspection report is received by us. 3.

c) you submit a fraudulent claim. d) there is an increase in the hazard covered by this policy that is within your control and that would produce an increase in the premium rate of this policy. 4. The effective date of cancellation cannot be before the 10th day after we mail the notice if we cancel for any of the reasons in item 3 above or the 30th day after we mail the notice if we cancel for any other reason. Our notice of cancellation must state the reason for cancellation. 5. If we cancel, our notice to you will state that if the refund is not included with the notice, it will be provided on demand. 6. We may not cancel this policy solely because you are an elected official Refusal To Renew 1. We may not refuse to renew this policy because of claims for losses resulting from natural causes. 2. We may not refuse to renew this policy solely because you are an elected officer. 3. We may refuse to renew this policy if you have filed three or more claims under the policy in any three year period that do not result from natural causes. If you have filed two claims in a period of less than three years, we may notify you in writing, that if you file a third claim during the three year period, we may refuse to renew this policy by providing you proper notice of our refusal to renew as provided in 4 below. If we do not notify you after the second claim, we may not refuse to renew this policy because of losses. A claim does not include a claim that is filed but is not paid or payable under this policy. 4. If we refuse to renew this policy, we must deliver to you, or mail to you at your mailing address shown on the Policy Declarations and any mortgagee named on the Policy Declarations, written notice of our refusal to renew not later than the 30th day before the date on which this policy expires. Proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice. If we fail to give you proper notice of our decision not to renew, you may require us to renew the policy. Charge For Insufficient Funds If at any time, your payment of any premium amount due is made by check, electronic transaction or other remittance which is not honored because of insufficient funds or closed account, you will be charged a fee. Misrepresentation, Fraud Or Concealment We may void this policy if it was obtained by misrepresentation, fraud or concealment of material facts. If we determine that this policy is void, all premiums paid will be returned to you since there has been no coverage under this policy. We do not cover any loss or occurrence in which any insured person has concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance. What Law Will Apply This policy is issued in accordance with the laws of the state in which the residence premises is located and covers property or risks principally located in that state. Subject to the following paragraph, the laws of the state in which the residence premises is located shall govern any and all claims or disputes in any way related to this policy. If a covered loss to property, or any other occurrence for which coverage applies under this policy, happens outside the state in which the residence premises is located, claims or disputes regarding that covered loss to property, or other covered occurrence, may be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which that covered loss to property or other covered occurrence happened, only if the laws of that jurisdiction would apply in the absence of a contractual choice of law provision such as this. Where Lawsuits May Be Brought Subject to the following two paragraphs, any and all lawsuits in any way related to this policy, shall be brought, heard and decided only in a state or federal court located in the state in which the residence premises is located. Any and all lawsuits against persons not parties to this policy but involved in the sale, administration, performance, or alleged breach of this policy, or otherwise related to this policy, shall be brought, heard and decided only in a state or federal court located in the state in which the residence premises is located, provided that such persons are subject to or consent to suit in the courts specified in this paragraph. If a covered loss to property, or any other occurrence for which coverage applies under this policy, happens outside the state in which the residence premises is located, lawsuits regarding that covered loss to property, or other covered occurrence, may also be brought in the judicial district where that covered loss to property or other covered occurrence happened. Nothing in this provision, Where Lawsuits May Be Brought, shall impair any party’s right to remove a state court lawsuit to a federal court. Action Against Us No one may bring an action against us unless there has been full compliance with all policy terms. Any action against us to which neither the Action Against Us provision located in Section I Conditions nor the Action Against Us provision located in Section II Conditions applies must be commenced within two years and one day of the date the cause of action first accrues. If an action is brought asserting claims relating to the existence or amount of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, under different coverages of this policy, the claims relating to each coverage shall be treated as if they were separate actions for the purpose of the time limit to commence action. Arbitration After a loss or occurrence, any coverage claim or dispute in any way related to this policy, by an insured person against us or us against an insured person, may be resolved by arbitration only upon mutual consent of the parties. Arbitration pursuant to this provision shall be subject to the following: House & Home Policy

If you replace the damaged building structure(s) at an address other than shown on the Policy Declarations through construction of a new structure or purchase of an existing structure, such replacement will not increase the amount payable under Building Structure Reimbursement described above. The amount payable under Building Structure Reimbursement described above does not include the value of any land associated with the replacement structure(s). Building Structure Reimbursement payment will be limited to the difference between any actual cash value payment made for the covered loss to building structures and the smallest of 1), 2) or 3) above. Building Structure Reimbursement will not apply to: 1) property covered under Personal Property Protection–Coverage C; 2) property covered under Other Structures Protection–Coverage B that is not a building structure; 3) wall-to-wall carpeting, fences, awnings and outdoor antennas, whether or not fastened to a building structure; 4) roof surface(s) when the loss is caused by windstorm or hail; or 5) land. Payment under a), b) or c) above will not include any increased cost due to the enforcement of building codes, ordinances or laws regulating or requiring the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of building structures or other structures. d) Personal Property Reimbursement. Under Personal Property Protection–Coverage C, we will make additional payment to reimburse you for cost in excess of actual cash value if you repair, rebuild or replace damaged, destroyed or stolen covered personal property or wall-to-wall carpeting within 365 days of the loss. Personal Property Reimbursement payment will not exceed the smallest of the following amounts: 1) the amount actually and necessarily spent to repair or replace the property with similar property of like kind and quality; 2) the cost of repair or restoration; or 3) the Limit Of Liability shown on the Policy Declarations for Personal Property Protection–Coverage C, or any special limit of liability described in the policy, regardless of the number of items of personal property involved in the loss. Personal Property Reimbursement will be limited to the difference between any actual cash value payment made for the covered loss to personal property and the smallest of 1), 2) or 3) above. Personal Property Reimbursement will not apply to: 1) property insured under Dwelling Protection–Coverage A and Other Structures Protection–Coverage B, except wall-to-wall carpeting; 2) antiques, fine arts, paintings, statuary and similar articles which, by their inherent nature, cannot be replaced; 3) articles whose age or history contribute substantially to their value. This includes, but is not limited to, memorabilia, souvenirs and collector's items; 4) property that was obsolete or unusable for the originally intended purpose because of age or condition prior to the loss; or 5) motorized land vehicles used solely for the service of the insured premises and not licensed for use on public roads. This does not include motorized land vehicles designed for assisting the disabled and not licensed for use on public roads. 7. Our Settlement Of Loss We will settle any covered loss with you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy. We will settle within 5 business days after the amount of loss is finally determined. This amount may be determined by an agreement between you and us, an appraisal award or a court judgment. If we notify you that we will pay your claim, or part of your claim, we must pay within 5 business days after we notify you. If payment of your claim or part of your claim requires the performance of an act by you, we must pay within 5 business days after the date you perform the act. 8. Appraisal If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either party may make written demand for an appraisal. Upon such demand, each party must select a competent and impartial appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser's identity within 20 days after the demand is received. The appraisers will select a competent and impartial umpire. If the appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we can ask a judge of a court of record in the state where the residence premises is located to select an umpire. The appraisers shall then determine the amount of loss, stating separately the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to you and to us, the amount agreed upon shall be the amount of loss. If they cannot agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A written award agreed upon by any two will determine the amount of loss. Each party will pay the appraiser it chooses, and equally bear expenses for the umpire and all other appraisal expenses. 9. Abandoned Property We are not obligated to accept any property or responsibility for any property abandoned by an insured person.

Appraisal
If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either party may 
make written demand for an appraisal. Upon such demand, each 
party shall select a competent and impartial appraiser and notify the 
other of the appraiser(cid:146)s identity within 20 days after the demand is 
received. The appraisers will select a competent and impartial 
umpire. If the appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire then an 
umpire will be appointed in the following manner:
a)  You or we will request the American Arbitration Association 

(AAA) to select an umpire at:

American Arbitration Association
Case Filing Services
Attn: Allstate Texas Appraisal
1101 Laurel Oak Road Ste 100
Voorhees, New Jersey 08043
Email: casefiling@adr.org
(with subject matter as (cid:147)Allstate Texas Appraisal(cid:148))

b) Only if AAA advises you and us in writing that it cannot 

appoint an umpire may we then jointly request a judge of a 
district court in the judicial district where the  residence 
premises is located to select an umpire. A judge of a district 
court does not include a commissioner or a judge of a county 
court at law, or a justice court, a municipal court, a probate 
court, or of a commissioner(cid:146)s court.

The appraisers shall then determine the amount of the loss, stating 
separately the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item. 
If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to  you and 
us, the amount agreed upon shall be the amount of the loss. If they 
cannot agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A 
written award agreed upon by any two will determine the amount of 
the loss. Each party will pay the appraiser it chooses, and equally 
bear expense for the umpire and all other appraisal expenses. 

If the appraisal process is initiated, the appraisal award shall be 
binding on you and us concerning the amount of the loss. We 
reserve the right to deny the appraisal award in part or in its entirety 
based upon the lack of coverage under the policy or failure to satisfy 
policy terms.

C.

Item 13, Action Against Us, is replaced by the following:

Against Us provision that no later than 91 days prior to 
commencing any action against us that we receive from you a

19. Mortgagee

A covered loss will be payable to the mortgagee(s) named on the 
Policy Declarations, to the extent of their interest and in the order of 
precedence. All provisions of Section I of this policy apply to these 
mortgagees. 

We will: 
a)

protect the mortgagee(cid:146)s interest in a covered  building 
structure in the event of an increase in hazard, intentional or 
criminal of, or directed by, an insured person, failure by any 
insured person to take all reasonable steps to save and 
preserve property after a loss, a change in ownership, or 
foreclosure if the mortgagee has no knowledge of these 
conditions; and
give the mortgagee at least 10 days notice if  we cancel the 
policy. 

The mortgagee will:
a)

furnish proof of loss, upon our request, within 91 days after 
notice of the loss, if an insured person fails to do so; 
pay upon demand any premium due if an  insured person fails 
to do so;
notify us in writing of any change of ownership or occupancy or 
any increase in hazard of which the mortgagee has knowledge; 
give us the mortgagees right of recovery against any party 
liable for loss; and
after a loss, and at our option, permit us to satisfy the 
mortgage requirements and receive full transfer of the 
mortgage. 

b)

b)

c)

d)

e)

If after we receive your proof of loss as described in paragraph 
c) above, you and we are still not able to agree on the amount 
of loss, then either party may make a written demand for an 
appraisal, as described in Section I Conditions, Appraisal. If 
this demand for appraisal is made before an action is filed 
against us in a court of competent jurisdiction, then the 
appraisal must occur before a suit can be filed against  us. If the 
demand for appraisal is made after an action has been filed 
against us in a court of competent jurisdiction, then the parties 
agree to ask the court to abate the further proceeding of that 
action until the appraisal is completed and a determination of 
the amount of loss is made as described in Section I 
Conditions, Appraisal. 

If property covered under  Dwelling Protection(cid:150)Coverage A is 
foreclosed upon under a deed of trust, the mortgagee of that 
property may cancel this policy at any time by notifying  us of the 
date cancellation is to take effect. We will send the refund, if any, to 
the mortgagee. 

The mortgagee must credit the refund against any deficiency owed 
by you and return any amount not credited to  you. 

This mortgagee interest provision shall apply to any trustee or loss 
payee or other secured party. 

All other policy terms and conditions apply.

To initiate the appraisal process either party must provide written 
notice of the dispute to the other party and make a written demand 
for appraisal of the amount of loss.

The time limit stated in item 13. b) shall be suspended from the date 
of the first written demand for appraisal until the date of the 
appraisal award.

We based your estimated cost on information provided by you 
and selected data that was available to us, which is described 
in the (cid:147)Insured property details(cid:148) section of your Declarations 
Page. Please review all the information in this section to ensure 
the accuracy of the information used to determine the 
estimated replacement cost of your home.

The enclosed Declarations Page shows the limit of liability 
applicable to Dwelling Protection(cid:150)Coverage A of your 
homeowners insurance policy. The estimated replacement 
cost of your home is the minimum amount for which we will 
insure your home.

The decision regarding the limit applicable to your Dwelling 
Protection(cid:150)Coverage A is your decision to make, as long as, at 
a minimum, your limit equals the estimated replacement cost 
as determined by Allstate and does not exceed maximum 
coverage limitations established by Allstate.

It is important to keep in mind that your Coverage A limits 
reflect a replacement cost that is only an estimate based on 
data that was available to us when we made this estimate (this 
information is described in the (cid:147)Insured property details(cid:148) 
section of your Declarations Page). The actual amount it will 
cost to replace your home cannot be known until after a 
covered total loss has occurred. Please keep in mind that we do 
not guarantee the adequacy of the estimate to cover any future 
loss(es).

How Is the Replacement Cost Estimated?
Many factors can affect the cost to replace your home, 
including its age, size, and type of construction. For example, 
the replacement cost uses construction data, such as labor and 
materials, that are available to us when we made this estimate. 
This estimate is also based on characteristics of the home, 
which include information that you provided to us. You might 
have chosen to insure your home for a higher amount than the 
estimated replacement cost shown above.

Note to Customers Renewing Their Policy
The estimated replacement cost for your home may have 
changed since the last time we communicated this information 
to you. This is because, at renewal, Allstate uses the home 
characteristics that you have provided to us to recalculate and 
update the estimated replacement cost. Using updated labor 
and material rates for your zip code, Allstate takes the home 
characteristics you have provided and determines the updated 
estimated replacement cost. The information about your 

Please note: Your Dwelling information is used to estimate 
your home replacement cost. It(cid:146)s important to review and 
update this information so we(cid:146)re using the most accurate 
details to estimate your home(cid:146)s replacement value.

If the information about your home shown in your Declarations 
Page requires any change or if you have any questions or 
concerns about the information contained in this Important 
Notice, please contact your Allstate representative, or call us 
at 1-800-ALLSTATE.

Identity Theft Expenses Coverage(cid:151)
Coverage for Identity Theft Victims

Certain Losses Are Excluded

Your policy contains several exclusions, which are listed in the 
sections titled (cid:147)Losses We Do Not Cover(cid:148) throughout the 
policy. All these exclusions can impact the coverage provided 
by your policy. Please review your policy, including all the 
policy exclusions, carefully.

Among the other exclusions, your policy does not provide

Property Protection coverage for loss caused by or consisting 
of any type of vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, toxic 
gasses, toxic liquids, toxic solids, waste materials, irritants,

Your policy also does not provide Liability or Medical coverage 
for bodily injury or property damage which results in any 
manner from any type of vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals,

irritants, contaminants or pollutants. However, bodily injury or 
property damage which results from heat, smoke or fumes

While modern technology has made our lives easier, it has also 
made it easier for thieves to commit identity theft.

Thieves begin by gaining access to personal information such 
as your Social Security Number, date of birth and driver(cid:146)s 
license number. They then use this information to set up fake 
accounts, open loans, rent housing, secure employment or 
even obtain medical care(cid:151)all without you even knowing.

As this crime grows increasingly common, consumers need 
options for dealing with the costs and hassles related to 
identity theft(cid:151)that(cid:146)s why we(cid:146)re offering Identity Theft 
Expenses Coverage.

For Just $30 per Year, You Can Get Help to Restore 
Your Good Name 
Now Allstate has a product that can help you if your identity is 
stolen. You can add this optional coverage to your property 
policy for just a few dollars a month(cid:151)a small price to pay for 
peace of mind(cid:151)especially when you consider that while other 
insurance companies typically require a deductible for similar 
protection, with Allstate there is no deductible.

(cid:151)

Additional Protection for Your Most
Valuable Possessions

Property insurance covers many belongings, but some items 
may require higher coverage limits than those in a standard 
property policy.

Scheduled Personal Property (SPP) coverage gives you 
additional protection against loss or damage to your valuables. 
It(cid:146)s protection not typically provided with standard property 
coverage. SPP benefits typically include:

(cid:151) No deductibles to meet
(cid:151) Coverage for lost or damaged items
(cid:151) Coverage for valuables kept in a storage location outside 

your home

Items That May Need the Extra Protection
SPP coverage provides protection for an array of valuable 
personal property. Here are some of the items you can protect 
by purchasing SPP coverage through Allstate:

(cid:151)

Jewelry (including wedding rings and precious or 
semi-precious stones)

Furs

(cid:151)
(cid:151) Cameras (digital, still, movie, video and related 

equipment)

Silverware and antiques (including furniture)

(cid:151)
(cid:151) Musical instruments

(cid:151) Collections (stamps, coins, music)
(cid:151)

Fine art works (including paintings, etchings, vases and 
sculptures)

(cid:151) Manuscripts or books
(cid:151) Home-office equipment (laptop, computer, audio/visual) 
(cid:151)

Sports equipment (such as golf clubs)

Affordable Protection for Your Valuables
The cost of SPP coverage varies, but the value of your property 
is the best way to determine how much coverage you need. 
The rates are generally a small percentage of the total value of 
the items you(cid:146)re insuring. This means that your valuables are 
being protected for only a fraction of the cost.

Regularly Review Your SPP Coverage
Even if you currently have SPP coverage, it(cid:146)s a good idea to 
review it annually. It(cid:146)s possible that the value of your property 
has changed or that you(cid:146)ve purchased new items that have not 
been added to your coverage.

To learn more about SPP coverage, or if you have any questions 
about your insurance policy in general, contact your Allstate 
representative, or visit us at allstate.com.

and peace of mind that comes with working with just one claim 
adjuster and one agent, instead of two or more for a flood 
claim.

Flood Coverage Is Affordable
The federal government sets the rates for flood insurance, so 
there(cid:146)s typically no difference in rates from policy to policy. 
You can switch to an NFIP flood insurance policy administered 
by Allstate for the same amount of premium you may be paying 
elsewhere. If you choose Allstate, you can have the quality 
service you(cid:146)ve come to expect from us.

For more information about flood insurance, or if you have any 
questions about your policy in general, please contact your 
Allstate representative or visit us at allstate.com.

 Allstate provides the standard flood insurance policy under the terms of the 
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations. The standard flood insurance policy is written by 
Allstate for the National Flood Insurance Program which is administered by the 
Federal Insurance Administration, part of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency.

Subject to availability and qualifications. Other terms, conditions and exclusions may 
apply.

What You Should Know About Flood
Insurance

Most homeowners, renters and commercial insurance policies 
do not provide coverage for flood damage. In fact, protection 
against floods is generally available only through a separate 
policy.

That(cid:146)s why Allstate is a participant in the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP) and offers standard flood insurance 
policies. A flood insurance policy can help complete the 
insurance protection for your property and help protect your 
financial well-being.

You May Have More Risk from Flood Than You 
Think
Approximately 90 percent of all disasters in the U.S. are flood 
related. While you may think that it couldn(cid:146)t happen to you, 
over 25 percent of all flood losses occur in low- to 
moderate-risk areas.

What(cid:146)s more, flood damage is often accompanied by other 
damage, such as wind and hail (which is typically covered 
under a property policy). So if you purchase your NFIP 
coverage through Allstate, you would have the convenience 

How We Compensate Our Agencies

The company listed below uses local agencies to assist 
customers with their insurance decision-making process by 
providing customers with information and high quality service. 
These agencies provide numerous services to customers on 
the company(cid:146)s behalf. Agencies are paid a commission by the 
company for selling and servicing the company(cid:146)s insurance 
policies and may be eligible to receive additional compensation 
and rewards based on performance.

Use Of Credit Information Disclosure

Insurer(cid:146)s name:
Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company

Address:
2775 Sanders Road
Northbrook, IL 60062

Telephone number:
1-800-ALLSTATE (1-800-255-7828)

Allstate will obtain and use credit information on you or any 
other member(s) of your household as a part of the insurance 
credit scoring process.

If you have questions regarding this disclosure, contact the 
insurer at the above address or phone number. For information 
or other questions, contact the Texas Department of Insurance 
at 1-800-578-4677 or P.O Box 149104, MC104-PC, Austin, 
Texas 78714.

Section 559.053 of the Texas Insurance Code requires an 
insurer or its agents to disclose to its customers whether credit 
information will be obtained on the applicant or insured or on 
any other member(s) of the applicant(cid:146)s or insured(cid:146)s household 
and used as part of the insurance credit scoring process.

If credit information is obtained or used on the applicant or 
insured, or on any member of the applicant(cid:146)s or insured(cid:146)s 
household, the insurer shall disclose to the applicant the name 
of each person on whom credit information was obtained or 
used and how each person(cid:146)s credit information was used to 
underwrite or rate the policy. An insurer may provide this 
information with this disclosure or in a separate notice.

Adverse effect means an action taken by an insurer in 
connection with the underwriting of insurance for a consumer 
that results in the denial of coverage, the cancellation or 

Credit information is any credit related information derived 
from a credit report itself, or provided in an application for 
personal insurance. The term does not include information that 
is not credit-related, regardless of whether the information is 
contained in a credit report or in an application for insurance 
coverage or is used to compute a credit score.

Credit score or insurance score is a number or rating derived 
from a mathematical formula, computer application, model, or 
other process that is based on credit information and used to 
predict the future insurance loss exposure of a consumer.

SUMMARY OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS 
CONTAINED IN CHAPTER 559

PROHIBITED USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION.  An insurer 
may not:

(1) use a credit score that is computed using factors that 

constitute unfair discrimination;

(2) deny, cancel, or nonrenew a policy of personal insurance 

solely on the basis of credit information without 
consideration of any other applicable underwriting factor 
independent of credit information; or

(3) take an action that results in an adverse effect against a 
consumer because the consumer does not have a credit 
card account without consideration of any other applicable 
factor independent of credit information.

An insurer may not consider an absence of credit information 
or an inability to determine credit information for an applicant 
for insurance coverage or insured as a factor in underwriting or 
rating an insurance policy unless the insurer:

(1) has statistical, actuarial, or reasonable underwriting 

information that: (A) is reasonably related to actual or 
anticipated loss experience; and (B) shows that the 
absence of credit information could result in actual or 
anticipated loss differences;

(2) treats the consumer as if the applicant for insurance 

coverage or insured had neutral credit information, as 
defined by the insurer; or

(3) excludes the use of credit information as a factor in 

underwriting and uses only other underwriting criteria.

NEGATIVE FACTORS.  An insurer may not use any of the 
following as a negative factor in any credit scoring

methodology or in reviewing credit information to underwrite 
or rate a policy of personal insurance:

(1) a credit inquiry that is not initiated by the consumer;

(2) an inquiry relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on 

a consumer(cid:146)s credit report; or

(3) a collection account with a medical industry code, if so 

identified on the consumer(cid:146)s credit report.

Multiple lender inquiries made within 30 days of a prior 
inquiry, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the 
consumer(cid:146)s credit report as from the home mortgage or motor 
vehicle lending industry, shall be considered by an insurer as 
only one inquiry.

EFFECT OF EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS.  An insurer shall, on 
written request from an applicant for insurance coverage or an 
insured, provide reasonable exceptions to the insurer(cid:146)s rates, 
rating classifications, or underwriting rules for a consumer 
whose credit information has been directly influenced by a 
catastrophic illness or injury, by the death of a spouse, child, or 
parent, by temporary loss of employment, by divorce, or by 
identity theft. In such a case, the insurer may consider only 
credit information not affected by the event or shall assign a 
neutral credit score.

An insurer may require reasonable written and independently 
verifiable documentation of the event and the effect of the 
event on the person(cid:146)s credit before granting an exception. An 
insurer is not required to consider repeated events or events 
the insurer reconsidered previously as an extraordinary event.

An insurer may also consider granting an exception to an 
applicant for insurance coverage or an insured for an 
extraordinary event not listed in this section. An insurer is not 
out of compliance with any law or rule relating to underwriting, 
rating, or rate filing as a result of granting an exception under 
this article.

NOTICE OF ACTION RESULTING IN ADVERSE EFFECT.  If an 
insurer takes an action resulting in an adverse effect with 
respect to an applicant for insurance coverage or insured 
based in whole or in part on information contained in a credit 
report, the insurer must provide to the applicant or insured 
within 30 days certain information regarding how an applicant 
or insured may verify and dispute information contained in a 
credit report.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ERROR CORRECTION.  If it is 
determined through the dispute resolution process established 
under Section 611(a)(5), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 
Section 1681i), as amended, that the credit information of a 
current insured was inaccurate or incomplete or could not be 

verified and the insurer receives notice of that determination 
from the consumer reporting agency or from the insured, the 
insurer shall re-underwrite and re-rate the insured not later 
than the 30th day after the date of receipt of the notice.

After re-underwriting or re-rating the insured, the insurer shall 
make any adjustments necessary within 30 days, consistent 
with the insurer(cid:146)s underwriting and rating guidelines. If an 
insurer determines that the insured has overpaid premium, the 
insurer shall credit the amount of overpayment. The insurer 
shall compute the overpayment back to the shorter of the last 
12 months of coverage; or the actual policy period.

also will ask you to provide any documentation that will help 
your appeal. Once we receive your Extraordinary 
Circumstances Appeal Form and supporting documentation, 
we will evaluate your appeal and determine whether or not you 
qualify for a lower premium. In any case, you will be notified of 
the outcome of our review.

Thank You
Allstate values and appreciates your business. We look 
forward to helping protect what(cid:146)s important to you for many 
years.

You(cid:146)re Receiving the Responsible
Payment Discount

As an added benefit of being an Allstate customer, you(cid:146)re 
receiving our Responsible Payment Discount on your House & 
Home policy.

Here(cid:146)s how the Responsible Payment Discount works. From 
this point on, you will continue to receive this discount:

(cid:151)

(cid:151)

(cid:151)

If you pay your premium in full.

If you pay your premium through a third party (e.g., 
escrow).

If we do not send you a cancellation notice for 
nonpayment of premium (the billing notice we send when 
we don(cid:146)t receive your payment on time).

-

-

If we send you a cancellation notice for nonpayment of 
premium and your policy renews, the discount will be 
reduced at renewal, which may cause your overall 
insurance premium to increase.

If this discount is reduced because of a cancellation 
notice, we will add it back to your policy at renewal if 
no cancellation notices for nonpayment of premium 
have been sent to you within the most recent 
twelve-month period ending 45 days prior to your 
renewal effective date.

Payment Options to Help You Save Money
We want you to continue saving money with the Responsible 
Payment Discount, so we offer several ways to make paying 
your bills fast and easy. 

(cid:151) You can sign up for the Allstateﬁ Easy Pay Plan, which 

allows us to deduct your insurance premiums each month, 
or in full, from your checking account. You(cid:146)ll save on 

postage, have fewer checks to write, and have the monthly 
installment fee reduced.

(cid:151) You can also pay your premium over the phone with either 

a check or credit card. Simply call us toll-free at 
1-800-ALLSTATE. You(cid:146)ll be asked for your policy number 
when you pay by phone, so it(cid:146)s a good idea to have your 
policy documents in hand before you call. 

(cid:151) You can set up an escrow account to ensure your 

premiums are paid on time. (Please contact your mortgage 
lender for more information on setting up an escrow 
account.)

(cid:151) You can choose to pay your premium in full.

Have Questions? Please Contact Us
If you have any questions about the Responsible Payment 
Discount, or if you(cid:146)d like more information about the different 
bill paying options available to you, please contact your 
Allstate representative, or call us toll-free at 1-800-ALLSTATE.

Your Property Policy Includes a Tropical
Cyclone Deductible and a Windstorm
and Hail Deductible

The following is a summary of the Tropical Cyclone and 
Windstorm and Hail Deductibles. Please note that this is only a 
summary and is not a part of your policy. For detailed 
information about the coverage provided by your policy, please 
read the policy, including the Declarations Page, the Tropical 
Cyclone Deductible Endorsement, the Windstorm and Hail 
Deductible Endorsement and any other applicable 
endorsements. If you have any questions regarding the 
Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the Windstorm and Hail 
Deductible, the deductible options available to you or your 
insurance coverage in general, please contact your Allstate 
representative.

When does the (cid:147)Tropical Cyclone Deductible(cid:148) apply?
The Tropical Cyclone Deductible is a separate deductible that 
applies in the event of covered loss (cid:147)caused by tropical cyclone 
or by any object(s) driven by tropical cyclone.(cid:148)

For the purpose of the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, we’ve 
defined (cid:147)tropical cyclone(cid:148) as (cid:147)a hurricane, a tropical storm, or 
any wind, hail, rain, snow, or sleet accompanying a hurricane or 
a tropical storm.(cid:148)

If another deductible applicable to the loss exceeds the 
Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the greater deductible will apply. 
(cid:147)Please refer to the Tropical Cyclone Deductible Endorsement for 
other applicable definitions and provisions.(cid:148)

When does the (cid:147)Windstorm and Hail Deductible(cid:148) apply?
The Windstorm and Hail Deductible is a separate deductible 
that applies for sudden and accidental direct physical loss 
caused by windstorm or hail to covered property when the 
Tropical Cyclone Deductible does not apply. This is the total 
amount of deductible for any one loss due to windstorm or hail.

If another deductible applicable to the loss exceeds the 
Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the greater deductible will 
apply. (cid:147)Please refer to the Windstorm and Hail Deductible 
Endorsement for other applicable definitions and provisions.(cid:148)

What are the amounts of the (cid:147)Tropical Cyclone Deductible(cid:148) 
and (cid:147)Windstorm and Hail Deductible(cid:148) and how are they 
calculated?
Your Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm and Hail 
Deductible amounts appear on the enclosed Policy 
Declarations. When the Tropical Cyclone Deductible or 
Windstorm and Hail Deductible applies, we will pay for a 
covered loss only when the amount of that loss exceeds that 

deductible amount shown on the Declarations Page (subject to 
applicable policy terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions). 
We will then pay only the excess amount.

The following example illustrates how the Tropical Cyclone 
Deductible and the Windstorm and Hail Deductible are 
calculated when percentage deductibles are applicable. The 
amounts of your Tropical Cyclone Deductible and Windstorm 
and Hail Deductible would be based upon a percentage of your 
Dwelling Protection coverage limit. If your Dwelling Protection 
coverage limit is $100,000 and you have a 5% Tropical 
Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail Deductible, your 
Tropical Cyclone Deductible or Windstorm and Hail 
Deductible amount would be $5,000 (.05 x $100,000). If the 
covered loss is not caused by a tropical cyclone or wind or hail, 
the All Other Peril Deductible listed on your Declarations Page 
will apply.

You may have the option to reduce your policy premium by 
choosing a higher deductible. Please keep in mind that if you 
choose a higher deductible, your premium may decrease, 
however, the amount we pay you for a covered loss will be less 
when the deductible applies. Your Allstate representative can 
discuss your options with you.

If a percentage deductible applies to your Tropical Cyclone 
Deductible and Windstorm and Hail Deductible, it is calculated 
as a percentage of your Dwelling Protection coverage limit, 
your deductible amount will change accordingly if your 
Dwelling Protection coverage limit changes for any reason, 
including, for example:
(cid:151)
(cid:151)

you change your Dwelling Protection coverage limit; or
due to the application of the policy(cid:146)s Property Insurance 
Adjustment provision, if applicable, which may 
automatically increase your Dwelling Protection coverage 
limit as described in the policy.

Further details regarding these deductibles can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Deductible Endorsement and the Windstorm 
and Hail Deductible Endorsement. Again, if you have any 
questions regarding the Tropical Cyclone Deductible, the 
Windstorm and Hail Deductible, the deductible options 
available to you or your insurance coverage in general, please 
contact your Allstate representative.

consumer reports and your rights under the federal Fair Credit 
Reporting Act. In that notice, we explain why we order credit 
reports and explain how important it is for you to check the 
accuracy of that information. 

In the state where we issued your policy we are required by law 
to inform you of certain factors in your credit report(s) 
adversely affecting your credit-based insurance score. The 
most significant of these factors are:

The average number of months that accounts are listed on the 
credit report: Generally, the longer your average age of 
accounts, the more favorable your insurance score will be. 
Those with the most favorable insurance scores often have an 
average age of accounts of 16 years or longer. 

The number of months since the most recent delinquent 
payment: A delinquent payment is one made over 30 days late. 
Delinquent payments within the past five years may have an 
adverse effect on an insurance score and the more recent the 
delinquency, the greater the adverse effect. Please note that 
over time the impact of this type of delinquency on your 
insurance score will decrease and even disappear if there are 
no new delinquencies. Avoiding future delinquencies may 
benefit your insurance score. 

The presence of a collection within the past five years: When 
we refer to a "collection," this could include collections that 
were previously paid off or collections on closed accounts. We 
exclude medical collections that are identified as such. Those 
with the most favorable insurance scores will typically have no 
collections on their credit report. Avoiding future collections 
may lead to a more favorable insurance score. 

The presence of a derogatory item within the past five years:  A 
derogatory item may include a delinquency, a collection, or a 
derogatory public record, such as a bankruptcy, judgment, lien, 
repossession, or foreclosure. Avoiding derogatory items in the 
future may lead to a more favorable insurance score.    

You may request a copy of your TransUnion Personal Credit 
Report by writing to:

Consumer Report Information and Its
Impact on Your Insurance

Many factors play a role in determining your insurance 
premium. Among the factors we consider are the following: 
where you live, the coverages and limits you(cid:146)ve chosen and 
discount eligibility. In addition, we use consumer reporting 
agency information for eligibility and rating purposes. The 
federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to inform you 
when we take adverse action based on a consumer report.

As permitted by law, we ordered credit report information 
about you and your spouse, who are both named insureds on 
the policy.

Based in whole or in part on the information provided to us by 
the credit reporting agency listed below, Allstate Vehicle and 
Property Insurance Company is unable to offer you a lower 
rate: based on the credit information available to us.

give you the lowest premium we can provide. If you have any 
questions about the information contained in this notice, or 
about your insurance in general, please contact your insurance

The Connection Between Credit History and 
Premium
We determine premiums using the information you provide on 
your insurance application, as well as using other factors. 
Certain credit report information has proved an effective 
predictor of insurance losses. It also allows us to keep costs 
competitive by helping make it possible for customers who are 
less likely to experience losses to pay less for their insurance. 
Keep in mind we use credit history in addition to, not instead 
of, our other characteristics. By considering this information, 
we can match likelihood of loss to premium even more 
precisely, and we think that(cid:146)s good for our customers. It allows 
us to keep insurance costs as competitive as possible for the 
greatest number of policyholders. You can also learn more 
about our use of credit information, including ways you may be 
able to improve your insurance score, by visiting allstate.com. 

In states which have laws that provide couples entering into 
civil unions, domestic partnerships, or similar relationships the 
benefits, protections and responsibilities under law as are 
granted to spouses in a marriage in this state, the term 
"spouse" in this notice includes civil partners, domestic 
partners or any similar relationship recognized by the laws of 
this state.

Consumer Report Information and Its
Impact on Your Insurance

In an effort to keep insurance costs as competitive as possible 
for the greatest number of policyholders, we may consider 
certain prior insurance information, prior insurance loss 
information, driving information and motor vehicle reports 
(MVR), when determining our customers(cid:146) eligibility, premiums 
and payment options. We(cid:146)re writing now to let you know we 
recently ordered consumer report information about you and, if 
applicable, another insured person named on your policy, and 
we are providing you with additional details about this process. 

Based in whole or in part on the information provided to us by 
Current Carrier Database (CCDB), Allstate Vehicle and 
Property Insurance Company could not offer you a lower rate.

  3 Where to Get Information 1. Your insurance company. When you get a copy of your policy you will also get an “Important Notice” from the company. The notice explains how to contact your company and how to file a complaint. You may request a complete copy of your policy from your company at any time. 2. Your declarations page. The declarations page, also called the “dec page,” shows: (a) the name and address of your insurance company, (b) the location of the insured property, (c) the dates your policy is in effect, and (d) the amounts and types of coverage. Your company must list the exact dollar amount of each deductible in your policy. The declarations page, or a separate page, must also list any part of your policy that changes any deductible amount. 3. The Texas Department of Insurance (TDI). You have the right to call TDI for free at 1-800-252-3439 for information and help with a complaint against an insurer. You can also find information on the TDI website at www.tdi.texas.gov.  4. Resources for shopping for insurance. The Office of Public Insurance Counsel (OPIC) and TDI developed www.HelpInsure.com to help you compare rates and coverages for different insurance companies. OPIC also has an online tool to help you compare policies. You can find this policy comparison tool at www.opic.texas.gov.  What You Should Know When You File a Claim 5. Deadlines for processing claims and payments. You should file your claim with your insurance company as soon as possible. When you file a claim on your own policy, the insurance company must meet these deadlines:   Within 15 days after you file a claim: The company must let you know they received your claim. The company must also start their investigation and ask you for any other information they need.   Within 15 business days after they get all the information they need: The company must approve or deny your claim in writing. They can extend this deadline up to 45 days from the date they: (a) let you know they need more time and (b) tell you why.   Within 5 business days after they let you know your claim is approved: The company must pay the claim.  Note: TDI can extend these deadlines by 15 more days if there is a weather-related catastrophe.  If your company fails to meet these deadlines, you may be able to collect the claim amount, interest, and attorney’s fees.  6. Written explanation of claim denial. Your insurance company must tell you in writing why your claim or part of your claim was denied.  7. Reasonable investigation. Your insurance company cannot refuse to pay your claim without a reasonable investigation of the claim. You should keep records of all claim communications (including notes from phone calls) and other claim documentation (including damage estimates and receipts).  8. Information not required for processing your claim. Your insurance company can only ask for information reasonably needed for their claim investigation. However, they cannot ask for your federal income tax returns unless: (a) they get a court order or (b) your claim involves a fire loss, loss of profits, or lost income. 9. Release of claim payments from lenders. Often an insurance company will make a claim payment to you and your lender. If your lender gets the payment:   No later than 10 days after receiving it they must: (a) notify you and(b) tell you what you must do so the money can be released.   No later than 10 days after you ask for the money, they must: (a) send the money to you, or (b) tell you how to get the money released.  If your lender does not: (a) provide the notices mentioned above or (b) pay the money after all the requirements have been met, the lender must pay you interest on the money.  10. Notice of liability claim settlement. Liability means you are responsible for other people’s injuries or damage to their property. Your insurance company must let you know in writing:   About the first offer to settle a claim against you within 10 days after the offer is made.   About any claim settled against you within 30 days after the date of the settlement.  Who to Contact for Claim Disagreements 11. Claim disagreements. You can dispute the amount of your claim payment or what is covered under your policy. You can:   Contact your insurance company.  Important notices

Protection for low-value property. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy because the property value is low.  24. Protection for older houses. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on the age of your property. However, they can refuse to renew your policy based on the condition of your property, including your plumbing, heating, air conditioning, wiring, or roof.  25. Notice of nonrenewal. Your insurance company must send you a notice that they are not renewing your policy. They must let you know at least 30 days before your policy expires, or you can require them to renew your policy.  26. Notice of a “material change” to your policy.

Material changes include:   Giving you less coverage;   Changing a condition of coverage; or   Changing what you are required to do.  Instead of a notice of “material change” a company may choose to not renew your existing policy. If so, the company has to send a nonrenewal letter, but may still offer you a different policy.  Note: A company cannot reduce coverage during the policy period unless you ask for the change. If you ask for the change, the company does not have to send you a notice.  27. Written explanation of cancellation or nonrenewal. You can ask your insurance company to tell you in writing the reasons for their decision to cancel or not renew your policy. The company must explain in detail why they cancelled or nonrenewed your policy. X4927-5  O
