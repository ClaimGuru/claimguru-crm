Your policy includes a "Suit Against Us" condition which states that action brought against us must be started from the earlier of two years from the date we accept or reject the claim or three years from the date of the loss that is subject to the claim.

Flood Insurance: Your Homeowners policy does not provide coverage for damage caused by flood, even if the flood is caused by a storm surge. Liberty Mutual can help you obtain this coverage through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) if your community participates in the National Flood Insurance Program. Please call your representative for more information.  

Hail/Windstorm Deductible and Named Storm Deductible: This policy contains separate deductibles for windstorm/hail losses and named storm losses. This may result in higher out of pocket expenses. Your deductible will be listed with your Standard Policy in the Policy Deductibles section.

We’re Here to Help:  

If you would like more information on this change or have any other questions about your policy, please contact the customer representative shown on your Policy Declarations.  

The above summary is for information purposes only and does not provide coverage. Your new Declarations Page, in conjunction  with your policy and other applicable endorsements,  provides complete details of your coverages. If this summary conflicts with the applicable policy language, the policy language prevails.  

# AMENDATORY ENDORSEMENT - PAYMENT OF PREMIUM  

THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES YOUR POLICY - PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY  

It is agreed your policy is amended as follows:  

SECTIONS I AND II - CONDITIONS  

The following is added to existing SECTIONS I AND II - CONDITIONS:  

1. Payment of Premium. If your initial premium payment is by check, draft, or any remittance other than cash, coverage under this policy is conditioned upon the check, draft, or remittance being honored upon presentment to the bank or other financial institution. If the check, draft, or remittance is not honored upon presentment, this policy may, at our option, be deemed void from its inception. This means that we will not be liable under this policy for any claims or damages which would otherwise be covered if the check, draft, or remittance had been honored upon presentment.  

All other provisions of this policy apply.  

Choose The Payment Option That Works For You  

We are committed to making billing easy and hassle free. That is why we offer a selection of billing and payment options to choose from.

If we receive your payment after the due date, you may be charged a late fee of up to $\boldsymbol{\Phi}15.00\$ .

# Information about Homeowners Rate Determination  

Thank you for trusting Liberty Mutual Insurance to protect the things you value most. We want to provide you with the right coverage at the right price.  

Since you purchased your policy, new rating features may have become available, and we want to make sure you take advantage of them. We also want to make sure we have the most up to date information about you, your family and your home to ensure you have the right coverage at the right price.  

When determining your rate, we may consider many factors, such as your credit history, claims history, and household risk characteristics. For example, you may qualify for a discounted homeowners insurance rate if you have a newly installed roof or connected home devices. If your community recently added new fire stations or moved fire hydrants close to your home, that may also reduce your rate. An improved credit history could also lead to additional savings.  

You may request that Liberty Mutual re-evaluate your current insurance rate with your most recent information, including your credit history, before your policy expires on 09/20/2025.  

Policy rate re-evaluation is limited to one request per twelve-month period, or as otherwise permitted by law, and it may not result in a quoted premium lower than your current one. If you would like your policy re-evaluated, please call us at 1-866-500-8377 and someone from our team will be happy to help you.  

Discounts, credits and benefits are available where state laws and regulations allow and may vary by state. Please contact your insurance representative for additional details.

However, they cannot ask for your federal income tax returns unless: (a) they get a court order, or (b) your claim involves a fire loss, loss of profits, or lost income.   
9. Right to contract with a public insurance adjuster. Your insurer cannot include a provision in your policy that prohibits you from contracting with a licensed public insurance adjuster to act on your behalf in negotiating for or effecting the settlement of a claim.  

10. Release of claim payments from lenders. Often an insurance company will make a claim payment to you and your lender. If your lender gets the payment:  

No later than 10 days after receiving it they must: (a) notify you, and (b) tell you what you must do so the money can be released.   
No later than 10 days after you ask for the money, they must: (a) send the money to you, or (b) tell you how to get the money released.  

If your lender does not: (a) provide the notices mentioned above, or (b) pay the money after all the requirements have been met, the lender must pay you interest on the money.  

11. Notice of liability claim settlement. Liability means you are responsible for other people’s injuries or damage to their property. Your insurance company must let you know in writing:  

About the first offer to settle a claim against you within 10 days after the offer is made. About any claim settled against you within 30 days after the date of the settlement.  

# Who to Contact for Claim Disagreements  

12. Claim disagreements. You can dispute the amount of your claim payment or what is covered under your policy. You can:  

Contact your insurance company. Contact an attorney to advise you of your rights under the law. The State Bar of Texas can help you find an attorney. Pay a licensed public adjuster to review the damage and handle the claim. File a complaint with TDI.  

What You Should Know about Renewal, Cancellation, and Nonrenewal  

Renewal means that your insurance company is extending your policy for another term.  

Cancellation means that, before the end of the policy period, the insurance company:  

Terminates the policy;   
Gives you less coverage or limits your coverage; or   
Refuses to give additional coverage that you are entitled to under the policy.  

"Refusal to renew" and "nonrenewal" are terms that mean your coverage ends at the end of the policy period. The policy period is shown on the declarations page of your policy.  

13. Notice of premium increase. If your insurance company plans to increase your premium by $10\%$ or more on renewal, your company must send you notice of the rate increase at least 30 days before your renewal date.  

14. Insurance company cancellation of homeowners policies. If your homeowners policy has been in effect for 60 days or more, your company can only cancel your policy if:  

You don’t pay your premium when it is due; You file a fraudulent claim; There is an increase in the risk covered by the policy that is: (a) within your control, and (b) would make your premium go up; or TDI decides that keeping the policy violates the law.  

If your policy has been in effect for less than 60 days, your company can only cancel your policy if:  

One of the reasons listed above applies; They reject a required inspection report within 10 days after getting the report. The report must be done by a licensed or authorized inspector and cannot be more than 90 days old; or They find something that creates an increase in risk that you did not include in your application and is not related to a prior claim.  

15. Insurance company cancellation of other residential property policies. After your policy has been in effect for 90 days, your company can only cancel your policy if:  

You don’t pay your premium when it is due; You file a fraudulent claim; There is an increase in the risk covered by the policy that is: (a) within your control, and (b) would make your premium go up; or TDI decides that keeping the policy violates the law.  

16. Notice of cancellation. If your insurance company cancels your policy, they must let you know by mail at least 10 days before the effective date of the cancellation. Check your policy because your company may give you more than 10 days' notice.  

17. Your right to cancel. You can cancel your policy at any time and get a refund of the unearned premium.  

18. Refund of premium. If you or your insurance company cancel your policy, the company must refund any unearned premium within 15 business days from:  

the date the company receives notice of the cancellation; or the date of cancellation, whichever is later.  

You must let your company know you want the refund sent to you. If not, they may refund the remaining premium by giving you a premium credit on the same policy.  

19. Limits on using claims history for nonrenewal. Your insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on claims for damage from natural causes, including weather-related damage, or claims that are filed but not paid or payable under the policy.  

Appliance-related water damage claims. Your insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on an appliance-related water damage claim if:  

The damage has been properly repaired or remediated; and  

The repair or remediation was inspected and certified.  

However, your insurance company may refuse to renew your policy based on appliance-related water damage claims if:  

Three or more claims were filed and paid (including a claim filed by a prior owner on your property); or You (a) file 2 claims within a three-year period; and (b) after the second claim, your company gives you written notice that filing a third appliance-related claim could result in your policy not being renewed; and \$ You file a third claim.  

Claims other than appliance-related water damage claims. Your insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on other claims unless:  

\$ You (a) file 2 claims within a three-year period; and (b) after the second claim, your company gives you written notice that filing a third claim could result in your policy not being renewed; and   
You file a third claim.  

20. Limits on using claims history to increase premium. Your insurance company cannot increase your premium based on claims for damage from natural causes, including weather-related damage, or claims that are filed but not paid or payable under your policy.  

Appliance-related water damage claims. Your company cannot increase your premium based on a prior appliance-related water damage claim if:

Claims other than appliance-related water damage claims. Your insurance company cannot increase your premium based on other claims unless:  

You file 2 or more claims within a three-year period.  

21. Right to ask questions. You can ask your insurance company a question about your policy. They cannot use your questions to deny, nonrenew, or cancel your coverage. Your questions also cannot be used to determine your premium.  

For example, you may ask:  

General questions about your policy; Questions about the company’s claims filing process; and Questions about whether the policy will cover a loss, unless the question is about damage: (a) that occurred, and (b) that results in an investigation or claim.  

22. Limit on using credit information to nonrenew your policy. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy solely because of your credit.  

23. Protections from discrimination. An insurance company cannot refuse to insure you; limit the coverage you buy; refuse to renew your policy; or charge you a different rate based on your race, color, creed, country of origin, or religion.  

24. Protection for low-value property. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy because the property value is low.  

25. Protection for older houses. An insurance company cannot refuse to renew your policy based on the age of your property. However, they can refuse to renew your policy based on the condition of your property, including your plumbing, heating, air conditioning, wiring, or roof.   
26. Notice of nonrenewal. Your insurance company must send you a notice that they are not renewing your policy. They must let you know at least 60 days before your policy expires, or you can require them to renew your policy.  

27. Notice of a "material change" to your policy. If your insurance company does not want to cancel or nonrenew your policy, but wants to make certain material changes, then they must explain the changes in writing at least 30 days before the renewal date. Material changes include:  

Giving you less coverage;  

Changing a condition of coverage; or  

Changing what you are required to do.  

Instead of a notice of “material change” a company may choose to not renew your existing policy.   
If so, the company has to send a nonrenewal letter, but may still offer you a different policy.  

Note: A company cannot reduce coverage during the policy period unless you ask for the change. If you ask for the change, the company does not have to send you a notice.  

28. Written explanation of cancellation or nonrenewal. You can ask your insurance company to tell you in writing the reasons for their decision to cancel or not renew your policy. The company must explain in detail why they cancelled or nonrenewed your policy.

Section 559.053 of the Texas Insurance Code requires an insurer or its agents to disclose to its customers whether credit information will be obtained on the applicant or insured or on any other member(s) of the applicant's or insured's household and used as part of the insurance credit scoring process.  

If credit information is obtained or used on the applicant or insured, or on any member of the applicant's or insured's household, the insurer shall disclose to the applicant the name of each person on whom credit information was obtained or used and how each person's credit information was used to underwrite or rate the policy. An insurer may provide this information with this disclosure or in a separate notice.  

Adverse effect means an action taken by an insurer in connection with the underwriting of insurance for a consumer that results in the denial of coverage, the cancellation or nonrenewal of coverage, or the offer to and acceptance by a consumer of a policy form, premium rate, or deductible other than the policy form, premium rate, or deductible for which the consumer specifically applied.  

Credit information is any credit related information derived from a credit report itself, or provided in an application for personal insurance. The term does not include information that is not credit-related, regardless of whether the information is contained in a credit report or in an application for insurance coverage or is used to compute a credit score.  

Credit score or insurance score is a number or rating derived from a mathematical formula, computer application, model, or other process that is based on credit information and used to predict the future insurance loss exposure of a consumer.  

Summary of consumer protections in Chapter 559  

Prohibited use of credit information. An insurer may not:  

(1) use a credit score that is computed using factors that constitute unfair discrimination;   
(2) deny, cancel, or nonrenew a policy of personal insurance solely on the basis of credit information without consideration of any other applicable underwriting factor independent of credit information; or   
(3) take an action that results in an adverse effect against a consumer because the consumer does not have a credit card account without consideration of any other applicable factor independent of credit information.  

An insurer may not consider an absence of credit information or an inability to determine credit information for an applicant for insurance coverage or insured as a factor in underwriting or rating an insurance policy unless the insurer:  

(1) has statistical, actuarial, or reasonable underwriting information that: (A) is reasonably related to actual or anticipated loss experience; and (B) shows that the absence of credit information could result in actual or anticipated loss differences;   
(2) treats the consumer as if the applicant for insurance coverage or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer; or   
(3) excludes the use of credit information as a factor in underwriting  and uses only other underwriting criteria.  

Negative factors. An insurer may not use any of the following as a negative factor in any credit scoring methodology or in reviewing credit information to underwrite or rate a policy of personal insurance:  

(1) a credit inquiry that is not initiated by the consumer;   
(2) an inquiry relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer's credit report; or   
(3) a collection account with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer's credit report.  

Multiple lender inquiries made within 30 days of a prior inquiry, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer's credit report as from the home mortgage or motor vehicle lending industry, shall be considered by an insurer as only one inquiry.  

Effect of extraordinary events. An insurer shall, on written request from an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured, provide reasonable exceptions to the insurer's rates, rating classifications, or underwriting  rules for a consumer whose credit information  has been directly influenced by  a catastrophic illness or injury, by the death of a spouse, child, or parent, by temporary loss of employment, by divorce, or by identity theft. In such a case, the insurer may consider only credit information not affected by the event or shall assign a neutral credit score.  

An insurer may require reasonable written and independently verifiable documentation of the event and the effect of the event on the person's credit before granting an exception. An insurer is not required to consider repeated events or events the insurer reconsidered previously as an extraordinary event.  

An insurer may also consider granting an exception to an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured for an extraordinary event not listed in this section. An insurer is not out of compliance with any law or rule relating to underwriting, rating, or rate filing as a result of granting an exception under this article.  

Notice of action resulting in adverse effect. If an insurer takes an action resulting in an adverse effect with respect to an applicant for insurance coverage or insured based in whole or in part on information contained in a credit report, the insurer must provide to the applicant or insured within 30 days certain information regarding how an applicant or insured may verify and dispute information contained in a credit report.  

Dispute  resolution;  error  correction.  If  it is  determined  through  the  dispute  resolution  process established under Section 611(a)(5), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1681i), as amended, that the credit information of a current insured was inaccurate or incomplete or could not be verified and the insurer receives notice of that determination from the consumer reporting agency or from the insured, the insurer shall re-underwrite and re-rate the insured not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt of the notice.  

After re-underwriting or re-rating the insured, the insurer shall make any adjustments necessary within 30 days, consistent with the insurer's underwriting and rating guidelines. If an insurer determines that the insured has overpaid premium, the insurer shall credit the amount of overpayment. The insurer shall compute the overpayment back to the shorter of the last 12 months of coverage; or the actual policy period.

La Sección 559.053 del Código de Seguros de Texas requiere que una aseguradora o sus agentes informen a sus clientes si obtendrán o no información de crédito del solicitante o asegurado o de cualquier miembro(s) del hogar del solicitante o asegurado. Tamb ién es requerido que informen si van a utilizar la información como parte del proceso de evaluación de crédito para obtener un seguro.  

Si se obtuvo o utilizó información de crédito del asegurado o solicitante , o de cualquier miembro del hogar del solicitante o asegurado, la aseguradora deberá revelar al solicitante el nombre de cada una de las personas por las cuales obtuvo o utilizó los datos y la manera en que la información de crédito de cada una de las personas se utilizó para asegurar o clasificar la póliz a. La aseguradora puede proporcionar esta información junto con esta divulgación de información o por medio de un aviso por separado.  

Efecto adverso, significa una acción tomada por una aseguradora en relación a la suscripción de un seguro para un cliente que resulta en el rechazo de la cobertura, la cancelación o el rechazo a renovar la cobertura, o el ofrecimiento y la aceptación por parte del consumidor de un tipo de póliza, tarifa de la prima o del deducible aparte del tipo de póliza, precio de la prima o del deducible por los cuales el consumidor específicamente presentó su solicitud.  

La información de crédito es cualquier información relacionada con el crédito, derivada en sí mismo de un reporte de crédito o proporcionada en una solicitud para obtener un seguro personal. El término no incluye información que no esté relacionada con el crédito, sin importar si la información está incluida en un reporte de crédito o en una solicitud para obtener una cobertura de seguro o si es utilizada para calcular una calificación de crédito.  

La calificación de crédito o calificación de seguro es el número o índice que es derivado de una fórmula matemática, de una aplicación de computadora, un modelo, u otro proceso que se basa en la información de crédito, y es utilizado para predecir la exposición futura de un consumidor a la pérdida de seguros.  

# RESUMEN DE LAS PROTECCIONES PARA EL CONSUMIDOR CONTENIDAS  

# EN EL CAPÍTULO 559  

USO PROHIBIDO DE LA INFORMACIÓN DE CRÉDITO  La aseguradora no puede:  

(1) utilizar una calificación de crédito que se calcula utilizando factores que constituyen discriminación injusta.  

(2) negar, cancelar o negarse a renovar una póliza de seguro personal, únicamente en base a la información de crédito sin tener en consideración cualquier otro factor de suscripción que sea aplicable independiente de la información de crédito; o   
(3) ejercer una acción que resulte en un efecto adverso en contra del consumidor debido a que el consumidor no tiene una cuenta de tarjeta de crédito y sin tener en consideración cualquier otro factor, indep endiente de la información de crédito.  

La aseguradora no puede considerar la ausencia de información de crédito o la inhabilidad para determinar la información de crédito de un solicitante de seguro o asegurado como un factor en el proceso de suscripción o clasificación de una póliza de seguro, a menos que la aseguradora:  

(1) tenga información estadística, actuarial o razonable sobre la suscripción de seguros que: (A) esté razonablemente relacionada a una experiencia de pérdida actual o anticipada; y (B) muestre que la falta de información de crédito podría resultar en diferencias en las pérdidas actuales o anticipada;.   
(2) trate al consumidor como si la persona que solicita la cobertura de seguro o la persona asegurada tuviera una información neutral de crédito, según la definición de la aseguradora, o   
(3) excluya el uso de información de crédito como un factor en el proceso de suscripción y utilice solamente otro criterio para la suscripción.  

FACTORES NEGATIVOS. La aseguradora no puede usar cualquiera de lo siguiente como factor negativo en cualquier metodología para la calificación de crédito o para la revisión de la información de crédito para suscribir o calificar una póliza de seguro personal:  

(1) una consulta de crédito que no es iniciada por el consumidor;   
(2) una consulta respecto a la cobertura de seguro, si así está identificada en el reporte de crédito del consumidor; o   
(3) una cuenta de cobro con un código de la industria médica, si así está identificada en el reporte de crédit o del consumidor.  

Las consultas múltiples hechas por prestamistas dentro de 30 días a partir de una consulta previa, si son codificadas por la agencia de protección al consumidor (consumer reporting company, por su nombre  en inglés) en el reporte  de crédito del consumidor  como si fuera de la industria  de financiamiento de una casa o un auto, serán consideradas por una aseguradora como una sola consulta.  

EFECTOS DE PERCANCES EXTRAORDINARIOS. La aseguradora deberá, una vez que haya recibido una solicitud previa por escrito por parte del solicitante de seguro o asegurado, proporcionar las excepciones razonables de los precios del asegurado, así como también la clasificación de la evaluación, reglamentos de aseguramiento para el consumidor, cuya información de crédito ha sido influenciada directamente por una enfermedad catastrófica, por una lesión, por la muerte de un cónyuge, hijo, o padre, por la pérdida temporal de empleo, por un divorcio, o por el robo de identidad. En tal caso, la aseguradora puede considerar solamente la información de crédito que no ha sido afectada por el percance o deberá asignar una calificación de crédito neutral.  

Antes de poder otorgar una excepción, una aseguradora puede requerir documentación por escrito, que sea razonab le e independientemente verificable sobre el percance y el efecto que éste percance tuvo en el crédito de la persona. No es requerido que la aseguradora considere los percances que sucedieron en repetidas ocasiones o percances que la aseguradora reconsideró previamente como un percance extraordinario. Una aseguradora también puede considerar otorgar una excepción al solicitante para obtener una cobertura de seguro o a un asegurado para un percance extraordinario no mencionado en esta sección. La asegurad ora no estaría infraccionando ninguna ley o reglamento de evaluación, clasificación o precios, si ésta otorga una excepción bajo este artículo.  

AVISO DE UNA ACCIÓN QUE RESULTA EN UN EFECTO ADVERSO. Si una aseguradora ejerce una acción que resulta en un efecto adverso para el solicitante de seguro o asegurado basándose totalmente o en parte en la información que contiene un reporte de crédito, la aseguradora debe proporcionar al solicitante o asegurado, dentro de 30 días, cierta información sobre cómo puede el solicitante o asegurado verificar y disputar la información que contiene el reporte de crédito.  

RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS; CORRECCIÓN DE ERRORES. Si se determina por medio del proceso de resolución de disputas, establecido bajo la Sección 611(a)(5), de la Ley Federal de Informe Justo de Crédito (Fair Credit Reporting Act, por su nombre en inglés), (15 U.S.C., Sección 1681i), a como ha sido enmendada, que la información de crédito de una persona que actualmente está asegurada no era correcta o est aba incompleta o si no pudo ser verificada, y la aseguradora recibe aviso de esta determinación por parte de la agencia de protección al consumidor (consumer reporting agency) o por parte del asegurado, la aseguradora deberá reevaluar y reclasificar al asegurado a no más tardar del treintavo día, a partir de la fecha en que se recibe el aviso.  

Después de reevaluar o reclasificar al asegurado la aseguradora hará cualquier ajuste necesario dentro de 30 días, lo cual es consistente con las guías de evaluación y clasificación de la aseguradora. Si una aseguradora determina que el asegurado ha pagado demasiado por su prima, la aseguradora debe acreditarle la cantidad que pagó de más. La aseguradora calculará el sobrepago retroactivamente al período más cort o de los previos 12 meses de cobertura; o al período actual de la póliza.  

# Ask yourself: Do you have enough insurance coverage?  

It is important to select and maintain adequate amounts of insurance on your dwelling (Coverage A), other structures (Coverage B), and personal property (Coverage C).  

At each renewal, we may suggest changes to your policy limits. These suggestions are based on the information you provide  to us or your agent about your dwelling's  features and may also be supplemented by public record or inspection. In addition, labor and material cost trends for your area, provided to us by recognized residential construction cost specialists, are factored into the calculation.  

Methods, trends, and costs to rebuild change periodically, as do the estimation tools we use. It's always a good idea to re-visit your coverage limits with your agent. The following provides additional information to consider:  

# Let's make sure you have the coverage you need.  

Your agent uses replacement cost estimation tools to establish a starting point for your insurance coverage. But you know your home best. And we look to you to give your agent the most complete, up-to-date information in order to protect your home and your style of living. Here are two quick things you can do today:  

1. Look critically at your Policy Declarations page, which comes after the opening letter in this package. Do you believe you have enough Coverage A? (This is the amount you'd get for reconstruction of an as-close-as-possible replica of your home in the event of total loss.) If you' re not sure, call your agent for help.  

2. Take inventory. Compare the value of your personal belongings to the Coverage C amount on your Policy Declarations page.  

It's important to know: your home's market value is totally different from what it would cost to reconstruct. Today's market value reflects economic conditions, taxes, school districts, the market value of land, and many other factors that have nothing to do with how much it would cost to reconstruct your home from scratch.  

What would it cost to reconstruct?  

Reconstruction cost is based almost exclusively on the cost of materials and labor as well as demand for contractor services. In the event of total loss, a properly insured policyholder can rebuild with the same quality of materials and workmanship in their current home (unless replacement cost coverages were declined or a functional replacement cost policy was deliberately selected). Of course, we hope you'll never need these services. But we'll all sleep better knowing you're fully insured.  

How much would it take to reconstruct your home?  

Each home is unique. You know your home best. It's your responsibility to make sure you're fully insured. That means you need to have enough insurance coverage to rebuild your home and replace all of your personal belongings in the event of total loss.  

How can you determine your needs? Ask yourself the questions below. If you need help answering them, call your agent and discuss your insurance needs with them.  

They will assist you in determining how much insurance would be needed to fully protect your home and belongings.  

Your home's age (older homes tend to be more expensive to reconstruct) and style (contemporary, colonial, cape cod, etc.)  

Flooring - hardwood, ceramic tile, carpet, vinyl, etc. Heating system - gas forced air, heat pump, etc. Foundation type - basement, crawlspace, etc. Recent improvements you may have made (remodeled bathroom or kitchen, finished basement, added room)  

How much is enough to replace the structures surrounding your home at today's prices?  

Things to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:  

Your fence, detached garage, gazebo, barn, or storage shed If you have an in-ground swimming pool or just repaved your driveway or sidewalk  

What would it take to replace your personal belongings at today's prices?  

Things to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:  

All your basics (furniture, rugs, linens, kitchenware, tools) and every electronic gadget   
· Your entire wardrobe, your jewelry, medicines, and personal effects   
Have you made any big purchases lately? If you have a garage full of tools, are passionate about the latest gadgets, or collect just about anything, you should seriously consider getting more personal belongings coverage than the standard policy provides.  

We're Here to Help  

If you have any questions or would like to review your coverage limits, please contact your agent at the telephone number listed on your Policy Declarations and a member of our team will be happy to help. Thank you for trusting us with your insurance needs.
